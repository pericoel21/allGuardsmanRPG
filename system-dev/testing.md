# Testing
## Theory
Theory taken from videogame testing.
- Playtest the smallest playable part of the game.
- Test your pillars first.
### Types
- Domestic / smoke Test: Done by designers, small scale, cheap, testing the minimum requirements to work. Solo play. 
- Quality Assurance (QA): Is it a viable product? Can be internal or external. Done by test specialists. Editing. Functionality (compared to stipulations), usability, localization, compliance (with standards, company requirements, fabrication...)
- Game Testing: Many types of tests. Always external, impartial and non specialized. Basically, an average player. Managed by researchers, who are not developers.
	- Task Analysis: Observations about the player. Can they do a specific, short test? Use metrics like timing. Not really useful out of videogames.
	- Play Test: Tests for usability and fun. Game doesn't need to be finished. Players play a part of the game: Do a character, play a combat, simulate downtime...
	- Play Up: Play. But players say what they are thinking/doing out loud. Check if rules are understandable.
	- Play Through: Play the full game. Check for progression, motivation and difficulty and overall personal experience. Useful for modules or campaigns.
- Blind Test: send the game to be tested by randoms so you have opinions to show to publishers. Game is finished.
### Roles
- Observer
- Participant
- Researcher
### Tools
- Notes
- Sessions
## Tips
- It is not a regular game, you want to test specific stuff. Structure accordingly.
- Cut to the chase.
- Try not to run your own test games. Do not intervine.
- It is more useful to be the observer. Try to not be seen.
- Amount of people: as many as you can. More tests mean more confidence about what is a problem and what not.
### Collecting info
- Use the Likert scale (from 1 to 5).
- Avoid descriptive questions.
- Use closed, clearly binary questions to ask for qualitative stuff.
- Avoid questions without real benefits.
- Always think what is the use of the answer of any question.
