# Design Considerations
## On rolling dice
> See [[rolling-dice]]
### Why Roll Under?
- I like not having to set a specific difficulty class (like in many d20 systems).
- I also like having some variation on what number is the target for each action, given a set character (as compared to a fixed DC like in IC RPG).

### Why d12?
I love having a roll that determines both if it is successful or not, and the Tier of success. I started with a d100 system, but I don't see the point on having so many degrees of progression. With a d12 I get enough variation on the rolls to create a whole Tier of Success system. A die like d20 has too big of a result in some cases. The idea is to have PCs that roll a d12 and compare with a 3 to 8 range (usually). This gives a 1-8 Tier of Success range that can be augmented with tags.

### Why Black Jack?
I think humans like rolling big numbers. Bigger is better in this system. But also too big is bad. It feels like a balancing act.

## On Stats
> See [[pc-stats]]
### Why those Stats?
- I want to have as few stats as possible without loosing "grain" & specialization.
- I want to have a parallel between physical and mental stats:
	- Strength, Dexterity, Awareness and Intelligence are more active.
	- Constitution and Willpower are more passive.
- I like Stat damage on every stat.
	- The active stats might be damaged more often in a roundabout way (wounds).
	- The passive ones act as HP.

### Why different stats for PCs and NPCs?
In PCs it gives more freedom to adapt a description to a Stat. In an NPC, less stats (and the specific names for them) help the user look through it quick and understand the character.

## On Wounds
### Why don't ever affect CON or WILL with the wounds?
Because CON and WIL are the factors behind pain (Pain = CON + WIL + Luck). If I affect CON or WIL with wounds, it gets recursive and players have to modify Pain on the fly. I think it is a cleaner experience to calculate it once.

## On Tags, Tier and Success
### Why the heavy use of Tier?
- Global way to set power scales, so players and GM get used.
### Usually tags are added after the roll. Why?
- Assessing the roll must be simple -> this way, most of the rolls are just checking the outcome vs the stat.
- As a game designer, those un-modified rolls are simple to understand: they're percentages.
### Why the use of Advantage & Disadvantage?
> [!note] Golden Tags add advantage or disadvantage to a roll.

- If I need to modify a roll, this is a very easy and visual way. And players love handling several dice.
### Why still have the option to add modifiers?
> [!note] Silver Tags modify the stat up or down, in increments of 10, depending on the Tier.

- I prefer unmodified rolls or rolls with advantage.
- This is a third option, in the middle of natural rolls and /+/ or /-/ in terms of power.
- I do the 10s increment because anything less than that is barely noticeable by players.

## On Colors & Alignment
> [!note] Any character or faction can be represented by a combination of colors, and / or by an alignment.

- The colors give depth.
- The alignment can further inform in some cases.
### Is the game amoral?
- I specifically want to avoid imposing a moral code based on color and alignment.
- I believe morality should be a part of the game discussed at the table.
- I think the tags representing PC's personalities should be an important part of their personal codes.
- I still like how chaotic might be closer to evil, and viceversa, without being always true.
- I recommend giving or taking Corruption as a measure of how chaotic a character is, and this might happen in moments where the character acts good or evil; but a good act might be chaotic and add up to the Corruption!
### Colors
> [!note] The colors are Red, Blue, Green, White and Black.

- These colors are well known by the TCG community. Their meaning can be second nature to them, and can be acquired easily by others.
- They are a good number of colors without being too many.
- They represent concepts in an a-moral way. Morality may or may not be a part of the philosophy of a color.
### Alignment
> [!note] The alignment options are Chaotic, Neutral and Lawful.

- This makes the game feel old school.
- It still doesn't impose morality too badly.
