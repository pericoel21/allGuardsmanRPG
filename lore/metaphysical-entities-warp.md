Colors of wind (warp) are "flavors" of energy that attract or repel in the immaterium, both being influenced by, and influencing, the minds of mortals.

Chaos gods are just philosophical concepts & currents, motivated by the colors of warp. They have influence over entities, who do all the talking. I.e.: Khorne is an ubrella term for many entities.
Chaos gods get personified but never act directly.

When a character hears voices from the warp, they are talking to a demon or other entity, but not with a Chaos God directly.

Like a tree branching out:
Colors contain gods contain demons

Example: Nurgle and aisha both branch from green
