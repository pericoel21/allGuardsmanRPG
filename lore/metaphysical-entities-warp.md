Chaos gods are just philosophical concepts & currents. They have influence over entities, who do all the talking. I.e.: Khorne is an ubrella term for many entities.
Chaos gods get personified but never act directly.

When a character speaks with voices from the warp, they are talking to a demon or other entity, but not with a Chaos God directly.
