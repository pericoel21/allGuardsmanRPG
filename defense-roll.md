# The Defense Roll
When a PC is attacked by an enemy, a Defense Roll is required to determine if the attack lands or misses.

## Selecting a Stat
The player describes how the PC handles the defense. This allows for any Defense Roll to be done with any Physical or Mental [[pc-stats|Stat]], within limits.

> [!info] A good rule of thumb
> Typically, a Physical attack will be handled by a Physical stat, and viceversa for Mental attacks and stats. The only clear exception is using awareness to dodge.

> [!important] Freedom for the GM
> The next table is useful if a GM wants to really regulate how defending works in the system.
> 
> However, the idea is for players to be reasonable in their arguing. Therefore, a GM should feel free to impose penalties as they see fit when a player's idea is too out there.

| [[Constitution]] | Resist poison, sleep and other similar effects. |
| [[Awareness]]    | Dodging.                                        |
| [[Intelligence]] | Defend from illusions or traps.                 |

### Weapons that bypass some actions
Some weapons might specifically bypass some 
Telegraph
Weapon tags can specify which stat cannot defend against that weapon.

## Penalties & bonuses
> See [[cover]], [[tags]]

A GM will impose **penalties**:
- For situations where **defending is difficult** even if the selected stat is a good idea.
- For situations where the selected stat doesn't make a lot of sense.

A defense roll can have bonuses:
- If the PC is in cover while defending from a ranged attack.
- If the PC has [[tags|Tags]] that give some sort of defense.
