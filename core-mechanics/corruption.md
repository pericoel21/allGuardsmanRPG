# Corruption
> [!tip] Corruption in a nutshell:
> Corruption is a currency which can be used to re-roll any dice, at any point.
> - This re-roll is offered by the GM.
> - Accepting the re-roll increases the corruption score.
> 
> It is also a [[pc-stats|Stat]]:
> - Like all other stats, [[rolling-dice|Checks]] of Corruption can be asked by the GM.
> - Players can declare actions using Corruption as the stat for the check, but that increases the corruption score.
> - When a Corruption Check is failed, the PC gains a random [[Mutation]].
- Minimum corruption stat
- Getting rid of corruption
- Accepting the re-roll (d5 corruption? d10 depending on the situation?) 
## GM moves & advice
> [!tip] Running a scene with Corruption
> **Corruption is a PC currency, but it is not meta!**
> If a PC accepts corruption to re-roll, the first result *did* happen, but just after that, **the universe was altered.**
> 
> Accepting corruption must feel **hardcore,** here are a few examples:
> - **Slaanesh:** The damage taken is pleasurable, and not an impediment at all.
> - **Tzeentch:** The attack should have hit the PC but a freak, almost non-euclidean optical illusion shows how they are untouched.
> - **Khorne:** The attack is painful, but it doesn't really affect the PC besides making them incredibly angry and driven.
> - **Nurgle:** The weapon rusts, rots and breaks down, and half the arm of the attacker too. This saves the PC, but fills the area with an eye-watering stench.
> - **Baashtor:** Breakdown of tech

### The whispers
Positive personalities for Chaos Gods, for when they whisper.
- [[Nurgle]] is a jolly grandad
- [[Tzeench]] is wise and driven
- [[Slanesh]] is like a warm and soft hug
- [[Khorne]] drives you toward just and epic combat
- [[Baashtor]] justifies any science or curiosity
### Intrusive thoughts
([[Downtime]]):
Improvise or create a pool of activities that align with the dark gods. Ask the other players to write activities for eachother.
This ideas are thoughts that the PCs have "naturally".
If player accepts the master suggestion for an activity, they regain [[Luck]] but also gain corruption.
