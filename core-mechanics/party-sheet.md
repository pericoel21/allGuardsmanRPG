# Party Sheet
- Session-specific goals (give xp)
- Not really for an unique party, more a "faction we're working for sheet" even if the faction was created and composed only by PCs.
- Goals of the faction
- Assets.
- If a party roll fumbles, next session there's an event
- Put connections and wealth here?
