The game is always played in rounds. A round contains the turn for each character, plus the turns of the enemies, sometimes.
- During exploration, a round takes 5 to 10 minutes
- During combat, a round takes seconds, and it is the time it takes for every character to do a relevant action and reposition themselves.
- During downtime, a round can take several days to a week, and it is the time it takes for a character to pursue a meaningful accomplishment or work on a project.

The order of play can be determined by counting successes on an arbitrary roll, depending on the situation:
- Initiative roll: During combat, a number determined by the enemies must be beaten for each PC to act before the enemies.
- Out of combat, usually there is no need to determine the specific order the players act in. It can be useful and tidy to go clockwise around the table.
