## Wounds
- A PC has a number of wounds equal to their rank in Constitution, minimum of 1.
- Each wound has an amount of damage it can absorb equal to luck.
	- if the luck stat goes down, wounds are also worth less.
> [!example]
- I have 7 luck in a wound. My luck goes to 6. I still have 7, but if I go down to 5, now i can only recover to 6. If I take a wound, the next wound is also 6.

Damage taken is:
1. Reduced my armor.
2. Marked in a wound.
3. If the wound fills up, it does not carry over.
