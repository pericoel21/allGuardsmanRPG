## Using Stats for social interactions
To arbitrate social interactions, any Stat can be used if deem adequate.

> [!tip] Remember: characters always have social tags.

Connections and Wealth are the only two stats clearly intended for social interplay, but they are used more as a currency, and not for every interaction.

> [!example] Examples of the Social Standing Stats
> - Connections can be used in a Check for a PC to be recognized or famous.
> - Spending points in Connections can mean calling for favors or failing to aid friends.
> 
> - Wealth can be used in a Check to see if a PC can afford to buy an especially expensive item or service (compared to their regular income).
> - Spending points in Wealth can mean needing to change your lifestyle to a more frugal one or losing assets.

> [!example] Examples of the other Stats
> - Strength is the default stat for intimidation.
> - Dexterity can be used for fast-talking.
> - Constitution could mean standing your ground in a conversation,
> - Awareness allows the PC to pick on hidden details or nervous movements.
> - Intelligence allows a PC to discover holes in an argument or to understand the subconscious details.
> - Wisdom gives the PC all types of hints subconsciously and allows to answer with calming words.
> - Low corruption could put a PC on the side of devout characters and can mean people or even animals are more relax around them.
> - High corruption could make enemies of humanity more friendly with the PC and can make them intimidating for regular mortals.
> - The current Luck of a PC might be used for some rolls.
