## Principles
I'm looking for:
- Order of play / initiative: Don't ever break turn order!
- Simplicity:
	- Less rolls.
	- Player facing rolls
	- Success levels. Same roll for success & effort.
- Dynamic gameplay.
- No division between combat and regular play.
## Brainstorming
- Track failures of all PCs. Triggers when X failures are met. Clocks.
- MTG alignment?
- Dungeon exploration procedures
- Create The All Guardsman Party NPCs
- Wounds. HP = luck?
	- Combat drugs? Duplicate Stat scores for some time?
	- 1 wound = 5 hp? for humans
	- Healing?
	- Loadsticks! Recaf! Stimpacks!
- Tags que repercuten en el Stat utilizado (a√±adiendo 10% por tier?).
- Clerics recover luck naturally. Is that a tag?
- Serving the emperor recovers luck or lowers corruption.
- 
But luck affects psyker magic and guns jamming, and crits and fumbles.
luck: d10 roll under for rnd events
### Tags
- Create AOI (flamer ie)
