# Position & Effect
> See [[rolling-dice]]

Position & Effect are two concepts introduced in *Blades in the Dark.* They describe **any narrative element which has a mechanical consequence when a roll is made**.

> [!info] Position & Effect in a nutshell
> The roll is negotiated before dice are thrown, determining:
> - What the players and GM **expected outcome** of the action is.
> - What mechanical elements intervine in the roll (mainly Tags and Stats).
> - Physical & emotional **situation of the PCs.**
> - **External factors:** How the environment, obstacles and NPCs factor in the roll.
> - **Tags:** How equipment and other factors factor in the roll
> - What **possible outcomes** can happen, in broad strokes.

In order to roll a Check or a Test, a discussion must take place between all players at the table. The outcome of this discussion, however brief it is, must answer:
- 多**What does the player want** their PC to do?
- 多**What does a success grant**, in the eyes of the player?
- 多What **negative outcomes** can a failure bring?
- 多What **factors** are acting in favor or against the PC?

Knowing the answers to this questions mean using extra mechanics when rolling:

| Factor                                                        | Mechanic                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Very relevant difficulty / advantage, not expressed by Tags   | Advantage or Disadvantage                                |
| Item properties, PC traits, environmental factors             | Tags                                                     |
| Difficulty, length or duration of the task                    | $ needed                                                 |
| Extreme Difficulty or illogical expectations                  | Automatic Failure                                        |
| Situation with no tension or extremely easy or routine action | Automatic Success                                        |
| Extremely specific situation                                  | Specific Stat or a set of specific Stats must be choosen |

## Success Tier needed
Within the discussion about Position & Effect, one of the most important mechanical elements to be determined is the Tier of Success. Although Checks may need more than 1$ too, it is especially vital for Tests.

| $   | Use for a Check                      | Use for a Test                              |
| --- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Standard                             |                                             |
| 2   | Standard with some "umpf"            |                                             |
| 3   | Difficult                            | Standard easy                               |
| 4   |                                      |                                             |
| 5   |                                      |                                             |
| 6   |                                      | Standard hard                               |
| 7   | Challenge for an expert on that task |                                             |
| 8   |                                      |                                             |

| 11  |                                      |                                             |
| 12  |                                      | Task that involves many other smaller tasks |


## Advantage & Disadvantage
Specific situations might impose Advantage or Disadvantage on a roll. This represent a complication or difficulty which stands from the environment or the emotional situation.
- Imposing both advantage or disadvantage on a roll **cancel each other one to one.**
- Several Advantages or Disadvantages **can be stacked.**
- Advantage is denoted with **/+/** and a number in front (if more than 1).
- Disadvantage is denoted with **/-/** and a number in front (if more than 1).

> [!example]
> **2/+/** is a roll with **2 Advantages.**
> **/-/** is a roll with **1 Disadvantage.**
> A roll with 3/+/ and 2/-/ results in a roll with **/+/ (1 Advantage).**

> [!tip] When to use it
> Note that Advantage and Disadvantage **make any roll much more likely to succeed or fail, respectively.**
> 
> Although advantage and disadvantage can stack, it is better to **consider well what is the most determinant factor in the roll.**
> Then, **see if a tag could better represent it,** and if the factor is so important that /+/ or /-/ is really needed.
#### Rolling with Advantage or Disadvantage.
1. The Player **rolls a number of times** equal to the /+/ or /-/.
2. The Player **picks one of the outcomes:**
	- The **worst** if rolling with **Disadvantage.**
	- The **best** if rolling with **Advantage.**
> [!info] Outcome hierarchy
> Regardless of the number:
> - A Critical Success is always better than a Success.
> - A Success is always better than a Failure.
> - A Failure is always better than a Critical Failure.

> [!example]
> When rolling **3/+/,** a player **rolls thrice** and obtains **96, 21, 11** for a stat with 43 points. The player **selects the 11 outcome,** as it is a **critical success.**
> When rolling **/-/,** a player rolls two d100 and obtains **77 and 94** for a stat with 50 points. Both are failures, but **the 77 is a critical failure,** so the player **must choose it.**
