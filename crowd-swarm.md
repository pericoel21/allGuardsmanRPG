# Crowds & Swarms
Crowds and Swarms are **groups of weak NPCs represented as a single character** for ease of use:
- They have a **singular statblock** character sheet.
- They all perform a **single action** in their turn.
- They have **low Pain thresholds**.
- They have **wounds equal to their Tier**.

### Crowds
- Groups of NPCs where **each one would move and act more or less individually**.
- It is usual for Crowds to be composed of **humanoids** or creatures of a **comparable size**.
- They would have separate tokens at the table.

### Swarms
- Usually represent a **group of small NPCs**.
- Their size typically allows them to **maneuver** under, over or through the **space other characters occupy**.
- They would have a single token.

## Wounds in Swarms & Crowds
> See [[pain-wounds]]

Wounds in Crowds & Swarms represent the **amount of individuals** in them:
- In Crowds, **each wound available is a character alive**. Taking a wound means one of the Crowd members dying.
- In Swarms, **a Wound is a percentage of the population**. Each time the Swarm takes a wound, several creatures die.

Crowds & Swarms **add the number of available Wounds to to their Stats and to their Tier of Success**:
- The number of available Wounds is the total number of Wounds minus the current one.
- The **Stats that get benefited** by this bonus are those where **any Tag applies**.
- The Bonus **does not apply to [[pain-wounds|Pain]] or [[pain-wounds|Wounds]]**.

> [!example]
> A Crowd has 5 Wounds total, but one of them is taken. Therefore, they add +4 to their Stats (if applicable), and they get +4$ if they succeed.
