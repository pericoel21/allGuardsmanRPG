## Principles
I'm looking for:
- Order of play / initiative: Don't ever break turn order!
- Simplicity:
	- Less rolls.
	- Player facing rolls
	- Success levels. Same roll for success & effort.
- Dynamic gameplay.
- No division between combat and regular play.
## Brainstorming
- Create The All Guardsman Party NPCs
- Healing? Loadsticks! Recaf! Stimpacks!
- Serving the emperor recovers luck or lowers corruption.
- Recreate Maze Rats in wh40k (lots of tables)
- Tables for session 1 introductions: Prisoners, PDF squad recruitment...
- Table of Ridiculous Titles
- Create weather random tables: Toxic / Gothic (rain & thunder, dramatic) / Warp (rains blood or fire)
- Traits that discount XP to increase a stat
- Petty items = quantum inventory
- Psykers use tier die
### Tags
- PC thinks they are on a reality show and talk to an imaginary camera
- Clerics: Chaos related tag
### Lore
- Sheogorath as a dark eldar god
- Mechanicus create stuff on their sleep
- Loth as a Dark Eldar lore (spider god, combine wit Elder scrolls godess of spiders)
- Administratum Lord sees regulations as an alive system / organism that mutates.
- Fake witch because of a real artifact.
- Primarch mtg colors -> primarch as patreons
- Eldar gods patreons
- Necron shards patreons
- Ice cream truck archeotech
- If the game is space australia, i need a space crocodile dundee
