## Principles
I'm looking for:
- Order of play / initiative: Don't ever break turn order!
- Simplicity:
	- Less rolls.
	- Player facing rolls
	- Success levels. Same roll for success & effort.
- Dynamic gameplay.
- No division between combat and regular play.
## Brainstorming
- Wounds don't affect CON or WILL because it is a mess to calculate further wounds.
- Track failures of all PCs. Triggers when X failures are met. Clocks.
- MTG alignment?
- Dungeon exploration procedures
- Create The All Guardsman Party NPCs
- Wounds. HP = luck?
	- Combat drugs? Duplicate Stat scores for some time?
	- 1 wound = 5 hp? for humans
	- Healing?
	- Loadsticks! Recaf! Stimpacks!
- Tags que repercuten en el Stat utilizado (aÃ±adiendo 10% por tier?).
- Clerics recover luck naturally. Is that a tag?
- Serving the emperor recovers luck or lowers corruption.
- Primarch mtg colors -> primarch as patreons
- Eldar gods patreons
- Necron shards patreons
- Ice cream truck archeotech
- If the game is space australia, i need a space crocodile dundee
- $ para apuntar a una parte del cuerpo o desarmar (mismo coste ambas)
- 1s digit para parte del cuerpo en caso de herida.
- Player facing combat, but: enemies might have complicated actions. They roll a d10 and on a 1 they fumble.
- T'auva
- Horned Rat
- Recreate Maze Rats in wh40k (lots of tables)
- Tables for session 1 introductions: Prisoners, PDF squad recruitment...
- Ridiculous titles. Maybe table? Examle: Junior Honoriffic Assistant Arbites liason officer of the Planetary Defense Force
- Do clerics recover from chaos more easily?
- Mechanicus that fake the discovery of a STC to innovate without being labelled heretics.
- Change "MTG COLOR" to pentachrome color
- What to do with negative tags that are played well? And what with players that refuse to play them?
- Create a social combat page parallel to combat?
- Petty items = quantic inventory. In the party sheet: unlocked for the whole party.
- Aspects. alternative names for Wild Tags that mean similar things but are easily applied to other situations.
- Progression of Wild Tags

But luck affects psyker magic and guns jamming, and crits and fumbles.
luck: d10 roll under for rnd events
### Tags
- Create AOI (flamer ie)
- Gun Fu
- Cold Shot
### Lore
- Sheogorath as a dark eldar god
