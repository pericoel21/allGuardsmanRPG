# AllGuardsman RPG
This is *All Guardsman Role Playing Game*, a Tabletop Roleplaying System designed to play in a grimdark science-fantasy setting with lots of humor.

## The objectives of this system
### Old School gameplay
- A solid but minimalist system that allows for GM rulings.
- A game loop that stays always on turns.
- The system specifically supports a west-marches style of play, where players' ambitions guide the discovery of the world.
### Modern improvements
- d100 Black Jack system.
- One action, one roll: the basic roll gives all the information needed.
- A roll always matters; bad things can happen with any failed check!
- Clocks: they help keep track of events, threats and statuses with ease.
- Although the game is perfectly enjoyable if played with pen and paper, some mechanics take advantage of VTTs and digital resources.
## Setting
> *"Enough head-cannon to surprise veterans, and so little that players' ideas can be added on the fly."*

- The setting is heavily inspired by the lore some famous sci-fi wargames.
- The lore is supported in the mechanics, but only the broader strokes:
	- A demigod Emperor on his throne, far away.
	- A parallel dimension created by the emotion of people, populated by horrors.
	- A faction that prays to the soul of machines.
	- A galaxy always in war.
- The ideas and opinions of the GM should be always easy to implement.
	- The setting is vague enough that any GM can re-write parts of the cannon without contradicting any lore written in allGuardsmanRPG.
	- Plus, the mechanics will probably support the re-write.
- If any section of os40k talks about the setting, it will give ideas, use examples to explain mechanics or help the reader create their own setting.

# How to use this repo
I am creating this repository by pushing my local Obsidian vault. This means:
- The repository is mostly readable within GitHub, because it uses markdown formatting. All the vital information is readable in GitHub.
- GitHub won't offer some of the quality of life features that Obsidian does.

## The best possible experience
If you want the best possible experience, pull this repo into your local files and open it with Obsidian.

### Plug-ins
The only plug-in you need to see everything I see is **Dataview.** It shows databases made from other pages.

Some other recommended plug-ins I use:
- **Folder Notes:** for a small QoL improvement, where you can click a folder to open a note with the exact same name as the folder. This is a behavior that imitates Notion.
- **Templater,** only if you want to work in the repository as I do. It allows you to create or apply templates to notes. I use the templates in `_utility/templates`.
