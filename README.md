This is Old School 40k, a Tabletop Roleplaying System designed to play in a grimdark science-fantasy setting with lots of humor.

## The objectives of this system
- Old School gameplay:
	- A solid but simplistic system that allows for GM rulings.
	- A game loop that stays always on turns.
	- The system specifically supports a west-marches style of play, where players' ambitions guide the discovery of the world.
- Modern improvements:
	- d100 Black Jack system.
	- One action, one roll: the basic roll gives all the information needed.
	- A roll always matters; bad things can happen with any failed check!
	- Clocks: they help keep track of events, threats and statuses with ease.
