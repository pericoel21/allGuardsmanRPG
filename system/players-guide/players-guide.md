# Player's Guide
If you are a player and you need a quick reference on how to play the game, here it is!

> [!important] The system in a nutshell:
> This system mostly uses a **d12**. As a player, you will roll that die and compare the result to your Stats. If you **roll under or equal to your Stats and some modifiers**, you succeed the roll! On a successful roll, the **number in the dice is the Tier of your Success**, and more is better.
> 
> The main way to **better your chances** of succeeding on a roll is to use **Tags** because they give you bonuses. Some Tags could instead **apply negatively**, hindering you.

## Rolling dice
> See [[rolling-dice]]

When **performing an action that is not trivial**, a roll is required. In any type of roll, you must **roll a d12 and compare it to a Stat**. Sometimes the Stat has a modifier (it can be positive or negative).

| Outcome                                          | Meaning          |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| The roll is under the Stat with modifiers.       | Sucess           |
| The roll is over the Stat with modifiers.        | Failure          |
| The roll equals the Stat with modifiers.         | Critical Success |
| The dice comes 12 (naturally, with no modifiers) | Critical Failure |
When a roll is successful, the **resulting number on the die is the Tier of Success**. Sometimes it can have modifiers, both positive and negative.

The two types of rolls are:
- **Checks**: A single roll is performed. The Tier of success must beat the Tier of the Check, which can vary.
- **Tests**: A series of Checks are performed until a certain Tier of Success is accumulated between them.

## Stats
> See [[pc-stats]]

In general, you can use any Stat to perform any action. What is important is that you **describe an action that makes sense**, both for your character, and within the narrative. Then, the most appropriate Stat is selected to represent that action.

| Physical Stats   | Mental Stats     | Status Stats                   | Social Standing Stats |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------- |
| [[strength]]     | [[awareness]]    | [[corruption-chaos-intrusive-thoughts]]                      | [[connections]]       |
| [[dexterity]]    | [[intelligence]] | [[pain-wounds\|Pain & Wounds]] | [[wealth]]            |
| [[constitution]] | [[willpower]]    | [[luck]]                       |                       |

## Tags
> See [[tags]], [[tag-classes]], [[tag-metallic-colors]]

Besides your Stats, Tags are the other main way your character is defined. Tags are **short sentences that express an important aspect of a character**, an item or a place.

Tags can be used on a roll, if it makes sense. That way, whatever effect the Tag has is applied to the roll.

You can classify Tags in two ways:
- The **Class** of a Tag defines **when** can a Tag be applied.
- The **Metallic Color** of a Tag defines **how** can a Tag be applied, so, **what mechanical effect** does the Tag have.

| Class | Restriction                                    | Tier                                                                             |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Blank | Apply whenever possible. Just convince the GM. | Tier 1 by default. Usually Tier 1 or 2.                                          |
| Wild  | Apply whenever possible. Just convince the GM. | By default, low to mid Tier (2-3).                                               |
| Feat  | Apply only as specified by the Tag.            | The easier type of Tag to reach high Tier (4-6) without breaking the experience. |

| Color of tag | Roll modification                                   |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Golden       | Advantage / disadvantage                            |
| Silver       | Roll under Stat + Bonus (Bonus depends on Tag Tier) |
| Bronze       | Add $ after success ($ Tier equals Tag Tier)        |

## Combat
> See [[combat]], [[movement-action]], [[order-of-play]], [[defense-check]]

When entering a combat, all player characters roll an [[order-of-play|Initiative Check]]. This determines if they go before or after the enemies.

On their turn, characters can do two things from the following list (an action can be repeated twice):
- **Move**: Moving not only helps you **reposition** yourself around the location, but it can mean doing **stunts**, acrobatics, **jumps** and many other **maneuvers**. Therefore it can give mechanical bonuses... or be negative, if you manage to put yourself in danger!
- **Aim**: Through an Aiming **Test**, you can **better the chances of your next attack**.
- **Trickshot**: A Trickshot is an attack with increased difficulty, done in a specific way to either:
	- **Do more damage**, like in a blow specifically to the head.
	- **Impose a negative condition**, like in tripping someone.
- **Seize the Initiative**: Repeat the Initiative Check to see if you can do better this time.

When an **enemy attacks you**, you have an opportunity to **defend through a [[defense-check|Defense Check]]**. Similarly to any other Check in the game, the Stat you roll to defend depends on what you do when the attack comes your way.

## Damage
> See [[pain-wounds]]

Your character has a **maximum amount of Pain they can endure**. It **fills with the Damage** you receive. Once it **maxes out**, you receive a **Wound**.

**Wounds** are rolled in tables, and they can be **really nasty**. But the bigger wounds give you **Scars that act like powerful Tags**.
