# Clocks
> See [[rolling-dice]], [[tier-system]]

Clocks are counters that slowly fill when PCs fail rolls. They work as timers or trackers, and when a clock is filled, something happens - usually, negative. 

> [!tip] The idea behind clocks
> Any roll matters, that's why a failed roll has an effect, even if players don't immediately see it reflected in the narrative.

Clocks have three characteristics:
- **Ticks**: **number of segments** a Clock has. **One segment is filled with each failed roll**. It can correspond with Tier in other areas of the game.
- **Consequences**: The **result of filling the Clock**. It is an event or situation that **happens once the clock is complete**, and it is usually tied to the location or a character.
- **Feedback or hints**: It is better if the Clock **telegraphs the PCs about the incoming danger**. The perfect Clock communicates its Consequence with each filled tick.

> [!danger] Failed roll vs roll under Check Tier
> One Clock **Tick is filled when a roll fails**. This means that the outcome of a Check is a **number over the selected Stat** (plus or minus modifiers). This includes each Check in  Test.
> 
> Sometimes a Check is **successful** (rolling under or equal the Stat), but it **fails to generate enough Tiers of Success to overcome the Tier of the Check**. This situation **doesn't fill a Tick**, however.

Several clocks can be in place:
- **Locations** usually have **several Clocks**. After one Clock is filled and the Consequence played, the next Clock gets played - filling with failed rolls, as usual.
- **Characters** may have Clocks associated to them. This clocks might be filled in parallel to location ones, or one Clock can be prioritized over the other.

> [!tip] Telling players about the number of ticks, or not
> Depending on the player's preferences and the play style at the table, a GM might opt to **disclose the number of Ticks** of the clock:
> - **Disclosing** the number of Ticks can put the players in the **mindset of making the most out of their time, and being careful** with the environment.
> - **Hiding** the number of Ticks can **make players uneasy and keep them on the edge**, as long as they remember that a Clock is being used.

> [!danger] Players must know about Clocks
> **Clocks are a core mechanic of the system**. An experienced player knows that a clock will always exist in the background.
> 
> However, **if a player doesn't know** or remember that a Clock is active, **they might feel cheated** when, arbitrarily, **one of their failed rolls has a huge negative consequence**.
> 
> It is **important for players to be informed about the Clock rules**, and to realize that their **failed rolls always have consequences**.

> [!example] Example of a Clock:
> > *Catacombs 01, T4*
> > "From any nook and cranny, three **Swarms of Rats (T3)** try to ambush the PCs."
> > 
> > Hints:
> > - *Skittering* from within the walls and pipes.
> > - *Bones* with rodent *bite marks*.
> > - Almost *no insects or small animals*.
> 
> The name of the Clock, *Catacombs 01, T4* indicates:
> - This is the first Clock for the *Catacombs* location.
> - The Clock has 4 Ticks.
> 
> Because the Clock has 4 ticks, it is useful to have at least 3 descriptions. Each time a roll is failed, one of the descriptions can be used to hint the Consequence to the players.

## More complex clocks
- **Up and Down Clocks**: A Clock's Ticks could be **emptied by the action of the characters**, especially if the Consequence is very severe. It is recommended that this Consequence is known by the PCs, so they can work against its fulfillment.
- **Clocks for downtime**: Clocks can be **used outside the regular session play**. Factions' developments or broader events in the world can be tracked by the use of Clocks too.
- PC created clocks:
