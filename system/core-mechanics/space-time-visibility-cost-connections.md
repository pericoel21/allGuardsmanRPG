# Space, Time, Visibility, Cost & Connections
Use tier system.
Tiers can be offset.  [[system/core-mechanics/tags|tiers]]
> [!example]
> - Something that takes days (Tier 3) can be done in hours (Tier 2) for a Tier 3 price or with a Tier 3 effect.
> - Tier 3 Night Vision gear might change a Pitch Dark environment (tier 5) into one blurry and hazy (Tier 2)
