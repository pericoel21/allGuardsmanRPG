# Trickshots
> See [[combat]], [[attack-check]], [[rolling-dice]], [[criticals]], [[pain-wounds]]

A Trickshot is an **attack made to an specific part of the target, or in a very specific way.** The intention could just be to **make more damage,** but a Trickshot can also be used to **hinder** the enemy. 

> [!example] Examples of Trickshots:
> - A shot to the enemy's weapon to disarm them without damaging him.
> - Throwing sand to the eyes of an enemy to blind him.
> - Piercing through gaps in the armor.
> - Shooting the tires of a vehicle.
> - Throwing a wrench in the mechanisms of an enemy war machine.
> - Make a shot bounce on a surface to avoid cover.

## Rolling a Trickshot Attack
A Trickshot **can be declared both by the player or the GM.** The logic behind a Trickshot should be discussed briefly at the table, so when it is rolled everyone is in the same page:
- The **intended effect** of the Trickshot should be clear and consistent with the PC's actions.
- The **difficulty** proposed by the GM **should be logical**.

A Trickshot is usually a **bet**, because it **rises the Check's Tier**, making it more difficult. The roll must **beat the increased Tier, or just fail completely**.

## Trickshot Effect
There are three possible effects if a Trickshot is successful.

| Effect               | Description                                                     | Difficulty |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| **Hinder the enemy** | Impose a negative **Blank Tag** instead of causing damage.      | Easiest    |
| **Do extra damage**  | Increase the resulting **damage** of the attack.                | Hardest    |

### Hinder the enemy
Hindering the enemy consists on **creating a negative Blank Tag affecting that enemy**. That tag is defined when the Trickshot is declared:
- A brief discussion at the table is held to **name the Tag**.
- The **GM sets the Tier** for the Tag.
- The **Attack's Check Tier is increased by the Tier of set Tag**.

**If the attack still succeeds** even with the increased Check Tier, the **new Blank Tag is materialized**, along its narrative implications.

### Do extra damage
Doing extra damage consists in **targeting a specific part** of the enemy, or **attacking him in a special way**, with the intent of **damaging more severely**.

The benefits of this approach are:
- Obviously, the **damage is increased**.
- **If a Wound results from this attack**, the player has some limited freedom on **choosing the Stat affected** by the wound.

#### Increasing the damage
On a successful case of this specific Trickshot, add the [[luck|Luck]] Stat [[tier-die|Tier Die]] to the Tier of Success.

#### Choosing a Wound
When rolling in a Wound table after this Trickshot is successful:
- The player has **one more Advantage (+1/+/)** in their [[luck|Luck]] Stat [[tier-die|Tier Die]] for the roll.
- The player might choose any wound below the resulting one (that one included).
