# Order of Play
> See [[time-tiers]]

The game is **always played in Rounds**. A Round is one turn around the table: it contains the **Turn for each character, plus the Turns of the enemies**, if any.

## Duration of Rounds
The in-game duration of a round depends on the type of gameplay happening, and can be related to the concept of [[time-tiers|Time Tiers]].

| Tier  | Duration           | Gameplay                                                                         |
| ----- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0-2   | Moments<br>Seconds | Rounds in [[combat]]<br>Reaction to a trap<br>Conversation (play by play)        |
| 3-6   | Minutes            | Conversation (abstracted, where one roll resolves a whole dialog)<br>Exploration |
| 7-10  | Hours              | Travel<br>Rest                                                                   |
| 11-12 | Days               | [[downtime\|Downtime]]                                                           |
### Important cases
- During **exploration**, a round takes 5 to 10 minutes. It is the time it takes for a character to **accomplish one task** while moving around.
- During **combat**, a round takes seconds, and it is the time it takes for every character to **do a relevant action and reposition themselves**.
- During **downtime**, a round can take several days to a week, and it is the time it takes for a character to pursue a **meaningful accomplishment or work on a project**.

## Determining the Order of Play
Depending on the situation, it might be critical to know when PCs act. But regularly, the best way to keep the game structured is to simply go around the table player by player.

### Initiative Check
In some situations the **Order of Play of the characters matters**. This is the case of a combat, but other situations might require structure too.

For situations where an [[initiative-check|Initiative Check]] is required, the Order of Play is:

| Order | Who goes?                                                   |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1st   | **PCs who succeed** the Initiative Check.                   |
| 2nd   | Regular **GM Turn**. Enemies, traps...                      |
| 3rd   | **PCs who fail** the initiative Check **without Fumbling**. |
| 4th   | **GM Turn**. More enemies, environment.                     |
| 5th   | **PCs who Fumbled** on the Initiative roll.                 |
