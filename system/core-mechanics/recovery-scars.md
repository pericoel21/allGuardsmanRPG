T1 and T0 heal between sessions. Not the others
Does recovery have to do with shifting tiers of the wound?

Shift tiers to heal, with a roll of CON, and paying Luck for the rest (if you want).
If the Shift you generate is more than you need to heal (or if you recover with no wounds), recover Luck instead (but with a 2:1 cost)
Scars are positive tags, talk about the event they come from but also give a wild tag
