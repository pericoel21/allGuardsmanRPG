# Classes of Tags
The Class of a Tag **defines how broadly can the Tag be applied.**

| Type  | Restriction                                    | Tier                                                                             |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Blank | Apply whenever possible. Just convince the GM. | Tier 1 by default. Usually Tier 1 or 2.                                          |
| Wild  | Apply whenever possible. Just convince the GM. | By default, low to mid Tier (2-3).                                               |
| Feat  | Apply only as specified by the Tag.            | The easier type of Tag to reach high Tier (4-6) without breaking the experience. |

### Blank Tags (Basic Tags)
Blank Tags are generic Tags with no custom rules associated to them:
- The use of Blank Tags is negotiated at the table, with the GM having the last word.
- They can be employed both in favor and against the PCs.
- Blank Tags are flexible because they don't have specific mechanics or use cases.
- When a Tag is created, it usually is a Blank Tag.
- A Blank Tag is usually Tier 1, especially when it applies to PCs (and not the environment).

### Feat Tags
> [!note] Setting Precedents
> A Tag may become well known within a group of players. Therefore, the Tag doesn't need much discussion because it has a **precedent on what it does and when it is used.**

A **Feat is a Tag which has specific rules** associated to it, either because the ruleset specifies them or because those rules were created at the table.

> [!example] Example of Tags becoming a Feat
> Imagine a character with the Blank Tag *Happy Trigger Finger.*
> 
> The player always declares this Tag when entering combat, to add 1$ to their initiative.
> 
> After a few sessions, the GM might decide to standardize this Tag into a Feat Tag. In the process, the Feat Tag is given Tier 2, resulting in *Happy Trigger Finger, T2*.
> 
> The player now adds 2$ to the initiative rolls, but at the same time, they loose the opportunity to use the Tag to gain any other mechanical advantage.

> [!danger] Cognitive Load & Creativity
> Feat Tags have specific rules of how and when to be applied. This can be interesting because it **allows for powerful Tags which are regulated**. But it can also mean that players have to **remember** a bunch of **specific and conversome rules**.
> 
> In addition, Feat Tags allow for less creativity than Wild or Blank Tags - which don't have specific rules. This affects not only the player, but the GM, who might want to use the Tag in question against the PC.
> 
> The sweet spot is to have PCs with a low amount of powerful Feat Tags:
> - Where the Feat Tags are worded in simple and legible terms.
> - Where the player loves to use those Feat Tags because they are fun and define cool aspects of the character.
> - Where the rules of those Feat Tags are specific enough to make it difficult to "spam" them, but broad enough to allow for creative play.
> - Where the GM can use the Feat Tags against PCs, but still following the rules specified in the tag.
### Wild Tags
Wild Tags are very powerful because they refuse to be transformed into Feat Tags:
> [!important] The Anti-Feats
> A Wild Tag is a Tag that **can be applied in any way, shape or form if it is negotiated** as such at the table, and the **GM gives their approval.**
> 
> The Wild Tag **keeps functioning as an open-ended, negotiable Tag always,** and **never becomes a Feat** with a determined mechanic associated to its use.

- Wild Tags are rewarded by the GM and are created by GM fiat.
- A Tag can be created as a Wild Tag from the start, or it can become Wild at any point.
- Players should only have 1 to 3 Wild tags, including in their equipment.
- Wild tags should be somewhat specific.
- Ideally, a Wild tag should be as easy to invoke against the PC as it is to use in his favor.

> [!example] Example of a tag becoming Wild
> Imagine the previous character, with the **Blank Tag** *Happy Trigger Finger*.
> 
> Instead of transforming the Blank Tag into a Feat one, **the GM might reward the player's interesting uses of the Tag** - and their **acceptance of the bad consequences** of having too happy of a trigger finger.
> 
> Therefore, the Tag is transformed into a **Wild Tag**.
> 
> Mechanically, it is **weaker than a Feat Tag in some specific situations**.
> - For example, it keeps adding only 1$ to Initiative rolls.
> - Instead, a Feat Tag with Tier 2 or 3 would add 2$ or 3$.
> 
> It is a Tag with great usability both in favor and against the PC:
> - The player can be as **creative** as he wants when using the tag. As long as the idea is accepted by the rest of the players and the GM gives the green light, *Happy Trigger Finger* can be employed in situations where it is fitting, outside the obvious ones.
> - **The Tag should be used against the PC** too, probably resulting in a healthy dose of friendly fire. Both the GM and the players at the table can make use of that Tag in a negative way.
