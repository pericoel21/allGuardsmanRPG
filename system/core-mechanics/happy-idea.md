# Happy Idea
> See [[rolling-dice]]

Sometimes players have **meta knowledge**: They know information that their PC wouldn't. A good way to **rewarding the player** for being informed or clever, but at the same time **keep immersion**, is the concept of a *Happy Idea*.

*The Happy* Idea is **used if**:
- The information is **helpful on a roll**.
- It is **possible to justify** that the PC suddenly has that idea.
- The information adds to the **fun and immersion**.
- The information is **not destructive**, adversarial, or focused on stepping over the GM.

A *Happy Idea* works as follows:
1. The **player says what they know**, and express their desire to apply it.
2. The GM gives the **green light**.
3. The **PC rolls a Test or Check with a bonus**.
4. **If the roll passes**, it means that the **PC just had a revelation**, a *Happy Idea*, a piece of information that **now they know**.

> [!important] Good etiquette
> In some situations, it is possible that one of the players can go for a happy idea the second they see something they know, while the rest of the players are intrigued by it because they don't know what they are looking at.
> 
> It is highly encouraged for the GM and the players on the know to let everybody experience the mysteries.
> 
> Also, when the idea is already known by someone, the best attitude possible (maybe for the character, but always for the player) is to teach and inform. This is how newcomers can get invested in Lore that the veterans know!

> [!example] The classic Medieval Fantasy Example
> A party of Adventurers travel through a swamp in a medieval fantasy setting. Suddenly, a troll appears. One of the veteran players **knows that trolls are weak to fire**.
> 
> The veteran **waits for the second round** of combat to come, and then, he says:
> *- "I know how this monster works." -* He winks at the GM *- "Could I roll for my PC to have a Happy idea?"*
> 
> **The GM accepts**, and gives him a **bonus of 3$** because they think the player has been polite and with good etiquette.
> 
> The player decides to roll Awareness, and uses this roll as an [[aiming]] action. He is Tier 4 in AWA, +3 from the bonus, and +1 from the PC's tags. The roll must be 7 or less to pass.
