# Rolling the Dice
A roll is needed **when a PC performs an action where success is not granted**, and:
 - The PC is under **stress**.
 - The action is **complicated**.
 - The action's **progress, quality or duration is a factor to be considered**.

> [!danger] When not to roll
> Don't roll for actions which a specific PC should do easily, or when a failure would't result in an interesting complication.

 There are **three types of rolls**: *Checks*, *Tests* and *Opposed Rolls*.
 
> [!tip] Rolls in a nutshell
> - **Roll a d12 under or equal to a Stat** to succeed.
> - **The Tier of Success ($)** is the **outcome of the dice.**
> - **Check: pass or fail.** Tier ($) informs the quality of the success or the time it takes.
> - **Test:** checks until the **Tier ($) meets an arbitrary number** (Tier of the Test).
> - **Opposed Roll:** Rarely used. Useful for PvP situations. **Compare two Checks.**

> [!info] Some considerations:
> - **12s** are always **failures.**
> - **Failure leads to negative consequences** in any roll.
> - Success Tiers can inform **roleplaying and mechanical consequences.**



## Before rolling: Position & Effect
> [!info] See [[position-effect]]

In order to roll a Check or a Test, a discussion must take place between all players at the table. The outcome of this discussion, however brief it is, must answer:
- 多**What does the player want** their PC to do?
- 多**What does a success grant**, in the eyes of the player?
- 多What **negative outcomes** can a failure bring?
- 多What **factors** are acting in favor or against the PC?

Knowing the answers to this questions mean using extra mechanics when rolling:

| Factor                                                        | Mechanic                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Very relevant difficulty / advantage, not expressed by Tags   | Advantage or Disadvantage                                |
| Item properties, PC traits, environmental factors             | Tags                                                     |

| Extreme Difficulty or illogical expectations                  | Automatic Failure                                        |
| Situation with no tension or extremely easy or routine action | Automatic Success                                        |
| Extremely specific situation                                  | Specific Stat or a set of specific Stats must be choosen |
## The roll
A player **describes the action** a PC is performing and **selects the Stat** that better represents that action. Then, the player must roll a **d12** die. The roll is successful if the outcome is **equal or under the selected Stat, plus bonuses.**

### Tier of Success
> [!info] See more in [[tier-system]].

Whether a PC is performing a Check or a Test, the degree of effectiveness of their successes is measured by the **Tier of Success.**
- The **Tier of Success** is represented by the **$** symbol.
- On a successful roll, the **Tier of Success ($)** equals **the number** on the die.
- To completely succeed on a Check, the Tier of Success must be equal or greater to the Tier of the Check.

### Failure and consequences
> [!info] See [[clocks]], [[combat]]

A failure is a roll where the **outcome of the d12 is greater than the Stat** selected by the player (plus bonuses). A failure might have direct or indirect consequences:
- Many **locations have Clocks** associated with them. **Each failure ticks a segment** of the clock. Once it is completed, a **negative event** happens.
- In other situations, **failure might entail direct consequences**.
- In combat, a failure when dodging means a PC suffers an attack.

#### Criticals and Fumbles
- A *Critical* is a roll with the maximum outcome possible for it to be a sucess.
- A *Fumble* occurs when the outcome of a roll is a 12.

> [!example]
> A PC rolls [[strength]]. His STR score is 4. If the outcome of the roll is 4, the roll not only succeeds, but it is a Critical.

For criticals and fumbles, consult the tables [[criticals]]

## The Check
The Check is the simplest roll. The outcome of a check is more or less **binary,** but the **Tier of Success still matters**.

A Check is compared against a **Check Tier.** The check tier **is usually 1$,** where the PC only needs to succeed. Counting the resulting **Tiers of Success is still useful:**
- To assess the **magnitude** of the success.
- To determine the **duration** of the action.
- To represent the action within the **narrative.**

Sometimes, the **Check Tier** might be greater than 1$. The check **only succeeds fully if equal or greater.**

Some **negative consequences might be avoided** if the roll succeeds (equal or under a Stat) but **doesn't meet the Check Tier**.

> [!danger] Something to avoid
> If the check **can be attempted several times**, it might be better to rule it as a **Test**. In a Test the conditions for success or failure and for keeping or discarding $ are better taken into account.

> [!info] About Check Tiers greater than 1
> Usually, the Checks where the needed Tier of Success is greater than 1 come from mechanics like Dodging in combat, where a character might need to roll $ equal or greater than the enemies' capability of attacking.
> 
> Calling for Checks with Check Tiers greater than 1 can be done in an improvised manner, but it is not a crucial part of the game.

## The Test
> See [[helping-teamwork]]

The test is a roll that measures the degree of completion of an action over time.
- The **Test Tier** is the **Success Tier required to pass** each Check that composes a Test.
- To fully succeed at a Test, the PC needs to accumulate a **Success Tier equal to the Tier of the Test** during **several successful Checks**.
- The Success Tier **can be accumulated during several rounds** of play as long as the PC **doesn't fail.**
- The Success Tier can also be **accumulated by several PCs** if narratively appropriate.

> [!info] GMs: Give Feedback about $
> **Succeeding** Checks in a test should have an **in-world meaning** besides the meta concern of accumulating $. The characters must **have a diegetic reason to keep doing the action**, something that explains why do they "keep at it" instead of trying something different.
> 
> This also puts the PCs and the players in the same page: both know they're making progress. This way, communicating the required $ to the players might not be needed because they know, in character, that the task is completed when narratively appropriate.

### Failing a Test
If a **roll completely fails** (outcome is over the Stat plus bonuses), there are three possible outcomes:
- **Benevolent tests:** The test never fails. The Success Tier is saved even when a roll is failed, or the failures subtract Tiers of Success (without resetting the test).
- **Lost opportunity:** The test cannot be attempted again.
- **Test reset:** The test can be attempted again, but the accumulated Tiers of Success are lost.

> [!danger] Avoid players' frustration
> ...

> [!tip] Mix and match
 > It is possible to create a test that has several clocks, and changes from a test reset type to a lost opportunity one. This means that **the Test resets the first few times it is failed, but not infinitely.**

#### Benevolent tests
This style of tests have less severe consequences:
- In some cases, the Test might be attempted an infinite number of times.
- In other cases, a failure might subtract Success Tiers.

> [!example]
> Gambling machine: pull the lever as many times as you want, if you pay.
>
> Honey pot: Try as many times as you want to put coins in your pockets, while being shot each turn by enemies in the room.

#### Lost opportunity
In some cases, the Test is an **activity that can only be attempted once.** If it fails, the PCs loose the opportunity forever.
- Use this type of tests sparingly, and for optional content only.
- Try to have narrative elements that telegraph this volatile nature, so players know they only have one shot.

#### Test reset
Other option is to have a situation where, if the Test fails, it can be attempted again but starting all over.

#### Test clocks
For some tests, it might be interesting to have a [[clocks|Clock]] tracking the number of failed rolls. A test completely fails if the [[clocks|Clock]] is filled.

### Countdown test
Fill a clock vs npcs that empty it


## Tags and Rolls
Depending on the type of [[system/core-mechanics/tags|tags]].......

## Using Extra successes
Both for rolls and tests, accumulating successes over the needed number can:
- Lower clocks(?)
- Better the results of attacks / magic?

## Crits and Fumbles
see [[criticals]]
- Lower clocks?

## Calling the roll
How to communicate rolls efficiently:
Say: success tier x or failure

## Rolls with Stats scores greater than 11
> [!danger] Here be dragons
> Rolls with Stat scores equal to 12 or over are rare. This rules are here to be used sparingly, and to create powerful enemies. If actual PCs get to this range, the game might be broken. Alternatively, a temporary effect could raise their Stats to this point for some rounds. But they should be back to mortal territory after that.

A roll with a Stat score greater than 11 can still fail, but the success is very powerful:
- Failure: A 12 is a failure. Chance of fumble?
- Success: The Tier of the Success ($) is multiplied by the tens digit +1.

>[!info] Tens digit +1
> Characters don't easily get to this stratospheric Stat scores. In the odd chance they do, it usually will be reserved to the low tens range. This will mean doubling $.

> [!example]
> A roll of 7 under a Stat of 14 will mean 14 $ (7 is multiplied by 1+1; the first 1 comes from the Stat's tens digit).
> 
> If a character had 27 on a stat, a roll of 11 would mean 33 $ (11 multiplied by 2+1).
