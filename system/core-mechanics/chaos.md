# Corruption
## Mechanics
> [!tip] Corruption in a nutshell:
> Corruption is a currency which can be used to re-roll any dice, at any point.
> - This re-roll is offered by the GM.
> - Accepting the re-roll increases the corruption score.
> 
> It is also a [[pc-stats|Stat]]:
> - Like all other stats, [[rolling-dice|Checks]] of Corruption can be asked by the GM.
> - Players can declare actions using Corruption as the stat for the check, but that increases the corruption score.
> - When a Corruption Check is failed, the PC gains a random [[Mutation]].
- Minimum corruption stat
- Getting rid of corruption
- Accepting the re-roll (d5 corruption? d10 depending on the situation?) 
## Intrusive thoughts
([[downtime]]):
Improvise or create a pool of activities that align with the dark gods. Ask the other players to write activities for eachother.
This ideas are thoughts that the PCs have "naturally".
If player accepts the master suggestion for an activity, they regain [[Luck]] but also gain corruption.

## Narrative & GMing
The Corruption Score represents the specific point in between Chaos and Lawfulness a character's personality is at. Therefore, it also informs their interaction with the beings that represent those two concepts.

### Roleplaying Corruption
> [!info] Acting out a PC's Corruption
> Any character can more or less understand how chaotic or lawful it is, not because they feel the score itself, but because the Corruption Score represents how chaotic is their personality.

Acting out the state of corruption of a PC by the player is highly encouraged, but not needed or even easy for a player to remember.

The easiest way to bring out a chaotic personality is for the GM to present situations where a corruption roll is necessary.
- The roll itself is a good reminder for a player to roleplay their Corruption.
- A failure is a great opportunity for villainous roleplay and character development.
- A good twist for this roll is to present situations where having a high Corruption Score, and leaning into the Chaotic roleplay, actually opens doors for the players.
### Corruption and Metaphysical Entities
Check [[metaphysical-entities-warp]].
The type of Warp entity attracted by players depends on the type of corruption.
- Low Corruption Score (10-25?): Good [[faith-cleric-magic|Faith]] entities
- High Corruption Score: Warp entities

- [[Baashtor]] justifies any science or curiosity
#### Corruption in play
> [!tip] Running a scene with Corruption
> **Corruption is a PC currency, but it is not meta!**
> If a PC accepts corruption to re-roll, the first result *did* happen, but just after that, **the universe was altered.**
> 
> Accepting corruption must feel **hardcore,** here are a few examples:
> - **Slaanesh:** The damage taken is pleasurable, and not an impediment at all.
> - **Tzeentch:** The attack should have hit the PC but a freak, almost non-euclidean optical illusion shows how they are untouched.
> - **Khorne:** The attack is painful, but it doesn't really affect the PC besides making them incredibly angry and driven.
> - **Nurgle:** The weapon rusts, rots and breaks down, and half the arm of the attacker too. This saves the PC, but fills the area with an eye-watering stench.
> - **Baashtor:** Breakdown of tech
