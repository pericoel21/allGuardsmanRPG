# Character Progression
- S/T & L/T ambitions.
	- Tracker: Fills XP tracker:
		- Completed ambitions give more than failed ones (or dropped ones).
		- LT give more than ST
10xp -> level up
Max accumulated xp. 10 + 3 (luck?)
Increase stats (those decrease anyway)
Increase tiers of tags (profession tags, equipment tags...)
When level up it is possible to spend more than 10 xp if items / relationships contain xp

Creating XP items: roll wealth / relationship:
- Gamble an amount of xp
- If successful, save $ xp. The rest is wasted or wxchanged for wealth / connections
- If fail, lose wealth / connections or just loose the XP

To increase stat, pay the current tier + the next tier in XP. Luck costs double.
XP to heal wounds?

Discussion about tags, modify them if players don't play accordingly, make them grow if they do.

CON & WIL don't have wounds so make them harder to upgrade
