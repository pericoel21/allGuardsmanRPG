# Aiming
> See [[combat]], [[rolling-dice]], [[attack-check]], [[happy-idea]]

In combat, instead of attacking, **a PC can aim to better their next attack**.

> [!example] Examples of aiming:
> - Study the movements of an enemy, looking for an opening.
> - Try to find a weak spot in the armor of a vehicle.
> - Look for the perfect spot in a mechanism, where a chain reaction can be started.
> - Wait for an enemy to fall for a distraction.

The action of aiming is performed through a [[rolling-dice|Test]]. A PC can spend more than one turn accumulating the benefits of aiming.

## Selecting a Stat
Like in any other Check or Test, **it is possible to select any Mental or Physical Stat to perform the aiming Test** if the selection is truly **justified** and accepted by the GM. Nevertheless, some Stats are easier than others to justify.

> [!info] The typical options
> By default, **aiming is done with the [[awareness|Awareness]] Stat**. It fits almost any situation imaginable.
> 
> **[[intelligence|Intelligence]] might be the other common Stat** for aiming, representing:
> - A PC who has studied the enemy.
> - Technical knowledge applied against structures, machines...
> - Knowledge of biology weaponized.
> - "A happy idea".

> [!important] Freedom for the GM
> The next table is useful if a GM wants to really regulate how aiming works in the system.
> 
> However, the idea is for players to be reasonable in their arguing. Therefore, a GM should feel free to impose penalties or say no as they see fit when a player's idea is too out there.

| Stat             | Use                                                                                                              |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[strength]]     | Rare. Force an opening in a gripping combat. Aim artillery.                                                      |
| [[dexterity]]    | Rare. Possible justification in fencing.                                                                         |
| [[constitution]] | Very rare. Possible use in grapples.                                                                             |
| [[awareness]]    | Default for aiming. Justifiable in almost any situation.                                                         |
| [[intelligence]] | Easy to justify. Aim for mechanical elements or points of failure, or represent having studied the enemy before. |
| [[willpower]]    | Very rare.                                                                                                       |

### Penalties and bonuses
(bonuses or penalties depending on how justifiable is the stat, plus how well the approach fits. Go for AWA, or INT if it fits. Any other Stat can be difficult to justify)

## Failing the Test
> See [[clocks]]

A test can have several consequences on a failed roll. Some Tests might...
- **...just keep going**. The failed roll just wastes one turn.
- **...reset on a failure**, but might be attempted again.
- **...completely fail on a bad roll**, negating the possibility to aim again **unless the approach to aiming is totally different**. 

The important thing is to **make rulings that feel consistent and logical**. The motivation behind picking one option over the others must be **verosimilitud, drama and fun** at the table.

> [!example] Examples of different rulings when failing an Aiming Test roll
> **Just Keep Going**: A failure **doesn't reset or negate the test**. It just wastes time.
> > A sniper PC is hidden, out of combat, without being noticed by the enemy. She is carefully preparing for the perfect head shot.
>
> If she fails one of the aiming rolls, she just wasted time. *But time can be precious...*
> 
> **Reset on a Failure**: The test resets on a failure, but can be attempted again.
> > A machine cultist PC is trying to hack into a system. That system might reject his credentials: it has a password with 3 attempts. If the PC wastes the 3 attempts, he would need to reboot the computer.
> 
> This is a situation with a Test + a [[clocks|Clock]]. If the PC fails three times, the Test resets.
> 
> **Completely fail on a bad roll**: A failure ends the test, and makes it impossible to attempt the same roll again.
> > A warrior is scratching his head, trying to remember if he knows the weak spot of the beast in front of him. If he succeeds, he might recall a history from his home planet.
> 
> This way of handling Checks is perfect for recalling information: either the PC knows something (success), or he doesn't (failure).
### Disruptions
In some situations, the **Test might fail if a PC disrupts the process of aiming**. What breaks it is better discussed at the table, but it is important to **be consistent** with the narrative, **employ logic rulings** and **communicate openly** while gaming.

> [!example]
> A PC spent their turn during **two rounds aiming**:
> > The PC was laying hidden, on the ground, **carefuly lining the perfect sniper shot**.
> 
> On their third turn, **they wish to get up and move without loosing the benefits of aiming**.
> 
> The GM feels like **those benefits should disappear if the PC changes position**. So, the player is **given the option to take back his initial idea** and shoot, or just go with it and loose the benefits.
