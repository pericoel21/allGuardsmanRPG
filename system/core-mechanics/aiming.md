# Aiming
> See [[combat]], [[rolling-dice]], [[attack-check]]

In combat, instead of attacking, **a PC can aim to better their next attack**.

> [!example] Examples of aiming:
> - Study the movements of an enemy, looking for an opening.
> - Try to find a weak spot in the armor of a vehicle.
> - Look for the perfect spot in a mechanism, where a chain reaction can be started.
> - Wait for an enemy to fall for a distraction.

The action of aiming is performed through a [[rolling-dice|Test]]. A PC can spend more than one turn accumulating the benefits of aiming.

## Selecting a Stat
Like in any other Check or Test, **it is possible to select any Mental or Physical Stat to perform the aiming Test** if the selection is truly **justified** and accepted by the GM. Nevertheless, some Stats are easier than others to justify.

> [!info] The typical options
> By default, **aiming is done with the [[awareness|Awareness]] Stat**. It fits almost any situation imaginable.
> 
> **[[intelligence|Intelligence]] might be the other common Stat** for aiming, representing:
> - A PC who has studied the enemy.
> - Technical knowledge applied against structures, machines...
> - Knowledge of biology weaponized.
> - "A happy idea".

> [!important] Freedom for the GM
> The next table is useful if a GM wants to really regulate how aiming works in the system.
> 
> However, the idea is for players to be reasonable in their arguing. Therefore, a GM should feel free to impose penalties or say no as they see fit when a player's idea is too out there.

| Stat             | Use                                                                                                              |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[strength]]     | Rare. Force an opening in a gripping combat. Aim artillery.                                                      |
| [[dexterity]]    | Rare. Possible justification in fencing.                                                                         |
| [[constitution]] | Very rare. Possible use in grapples.                                                                             |
| [[awareness]]    | Default for aiming. Justifiable in almost any situation.                                                         |
| [[intelligence]] | Easy to justify. Aim for mechanical elements or points of failure, or represent having studied the enemy before. |
| [[willpower]]    | Very rare.                                                                                                       |
