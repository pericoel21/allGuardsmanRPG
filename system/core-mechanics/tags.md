## Tags 101
> [!important] Tags in a nutshell
> Tags are **descriptive words or sentences used to reflect qualities** of objects, characters or the environment.
> 
> The **Type of Tag** describe how broadly can a Tag be applied.
> The **Metallic Colors** describe how powerful a Tag is.

Tags are a tool to be negotiated on a table, and a group of players will get used to their custom tags. The GM has the ultimate word about the existence or not of a tag.

> [!important] Polivalent Tags
> It is recomendable to create Tags in such a way that they can be declared both as a positive and negative character trait or scene element, depending on the context.

Tags can be permanent, like scars, wounds, classes, races, professions... or temporary, like environmental elements or temporary statuses.

Tags can be created during play:
 - An already established element can be referred to as a Tag.
 - A GM can draw attention to an element of the narrative by creating a Tag. 
 - Players can improvise Tags, GM permitting.
 - Status effects are also represented with tags.

> [!note] It can be useful to have index cards at hand to note Tags during play.

> [!info] Tier 101
> **Any Tag has an associated Tier**. The Tier represents the magnitude, size or difficulty of the quality described by the Tag.

## Types of Tag
The type of tag defines how broadly can the Tag be applied.

| Type   | Restriction                                    | Tier                     |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Blank  | Apply whenever possible. Just convince the GM. | Usually Tier 1           |
| Wild   | Apply whenever possible. Just convince the GM. | Usually a low Tier (1-3) |
| Strict | Apply only as specified by the Tag.            | Can reach high Tiers     |

### Blank Tags (Basic Tags)
Blank Tags are generic Tags with no custom rules associated to them:
- The use of Blank Tags is negotiated at the table, with the GM having the last word.
- They can be employed both in favor and against the PCs.
- Blank Tags are flexible because they don't have specific mechanics or use cases.
- When a Tag is created, it usually is a Blank Tag.
- A Blank Tag is usually Tier 1, especially when it applies to PCs (and not the environment).

### Strict Tags
> [!note] Setting Precedents
> A Tag may become well known within a group of players. Therefore, the Tag doesn't need much discussion because it has a **precedent on what it does and when it is used.**

A **Strict is a Tag which has specific rules** associated to it, either because the ruleset specifies them or because those rules were created at the table.

> [!example] Example of Tags becoming Strict
> Imagine a character with the Blank Tag *Happy Trigger Finger.*
> 
> The player always declares this Tag when entering combat, to add 1$ to their initiative.
> 
> After a few sessions, the GM might decide to standardize this Tag into a Strict Tag. In the process, the Strict Tag is given Tier 2, resulting in *Happy Trigger Finger, T2*.
> 
> The player now adds 2$ to the initiative rolls, but at the same time, they loose the opportunity to use the Tag to gain any other mechanical advantage.

> [!danger] Cognitive Load & Creativity
> Strict Tags have specific rules of how and when to be applied. This can be interesting because it **allows for powerful Tags which are regulated**. But it can also mean that players have to **remember** a bunch of **specific and conversome rules**.
> 
> In addition, Strict Tags allow for less creativity than Wild or Blank Tags - which don't have specific rules. This affects not only the player, but the GM, who might want to use the Tag in question against the PC.
> 
> The sweet spot is to have PCs with a low amount of powerful Strict Tags:
> - Where the Strict Tags are worded in simple and legible terms.
> - Where the player loves to use those Strict Tags because they are fun and define cool aspects of the character.
> - Where the rules of those Strict Tags are specific enough to make it difficult to "spam" them, but broad enough to allow for creative play.
> - Where the GM can use the Strict Tags against PCs, but still following the rules specified in the tag.
### Wild Tags
Wild Tags are very powerful because they refuse to be transformed into Strict Tags:
> [!important] The Anti-Strict Tags
> A Wild Tag is a Tag that **can be applied in any way, shape or form if it is negotiated** as such at the table, and the **GM gives their approval.**
> 
> The Wild Tag **keeps functioning as an open-ended, negotiable Tag always,** and **never becomes Strict** with a determined mechanic associated to its use.

- Wild Tags are rewarded by the GM and are created by GM fiat.
- A Tag can be created as a Wild Tag from the start, or it can become Wild at any point.
- Players should only have 1 to 3 Wild tags, including in their equipment.
- Wild tags should be somewhat specific.
- Ideally, a Wild tag should be as easy to invoke against the PC as it is to use in his favor.

> [!example] Example of a tag becoming Wild
> Imagine the previous character, with the **Blank Tag** *Happy Trigger Finger*.
> 
> Instead of transforming the Blank Tag into a Strict one, **the GM might reward the player's interesting uses of the Tag** - and their **acceptance of the bad consequences** of having too happy of a trigger finger.
> 
> Therefore, the Tag is transformed into a **Wild Tag**.
> 
> Mechanically, it is **weaker than a Strict Tag in some specific situations**.
> - For example, it keeps adding only 1$ to Initiative rolls.
> - Instead, a Strict Tag with Tier 2 or 3 would add 2$ or 3$.
> 
> It is a Tag with great usability both in favor and against the PC:
> - The player can be as **creative** as he wants when using the tag. As long as the idea is accepted by the rest of the players and the GM gives the green light, *Happy Trigger Finger* can be employed in situations where it is fitting, outside the obvious ones.
> - **The Tag should be used against the PC** too, probably resulting in a healthy dose of friendly fire. Both the GM and the players at the table can make use of that Tag in a negative way.

## Colors of Tags
### Metallic Colors
There are several ways a Tag can affect a Check or a Test.

| Type of tag | Roll mechanic                                       |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Golden      | Advantage / disadvantage                            |
| Silver      | Roll under Stat + Bonus (Bonus depends on Tag Tier) |
| Bronze      | Add $ after success ($ Tier equals Tag Tier)        |
It is always important to keep in mind that it is possible to invoke a Tag both in favor and against a PC's roll.

> [!info] Metallic Colors & Types of Tags
> Note that any Metallic Color (Silver, Bronze, Gold) can be combined with any type of Tag (Blank, Wild, Strict).

> [!important] Power of the Tag depends on Metallic Color
> Golden Tags are much more powerful than the other two Colors. And Silver Tags are more powerful than Bronze Tags.
> 
> It is recommended to use Bronze as the default color for Blank Tags, and from there, increase their power if the Tag feels underwhelming.
> 
> Be very careful creating Gold Wild Tags. That said, Gold Wild Tags can define an interesting and entertaining PC.
#### Bronze
Bronze Tags **add the Tier of the Tag as a bonus or penalty to the Success Tier** of the roll (see [[rolling-dice]]).


> [!danger] This means that Bronze Tags only affect Successful Rolls.
> It is interesting to declare the narrative relevance of a Bronze Tag in the context of a roll. 
> 
> But it is better to wait for the full negotiation of a difficult to apply Bronze Tag until after the roll is successful. It might not even matter, if the roll fails.

> [!example]
> A PC has the Tag *Stupid T2* (a Bronze Tag). The player declares: *I attack stupidly.*
> 
> Only after succeeding the attack roll, the pertinent discussion about the Tag *Stupid* is held.
> 
> If the players like it, and the GM accepts it, *Stupid T2* adds + 2$ to the successful roll.
> 
> More likely, the GM might declare a penalty of -2$ to the roll.

#### Golden Tags
Golden Tags **allow for a roll to be done at Advantage /+/ or Disadvantage /-/.**
- The number of **/+/ or /-/ are equal to the Tier of the Tag.**
- Determining if a roll done by a PC is at advantage or disadvantage is simple:
	- /+/ if the PC benefits from one of his Golden Tags.
	- /+/ if the player exploits a Golden Tag that is considered a weakness of someone or something outside the PC.
	- /-/ if the Golden Tag is used against the PC.
	- /-/ if the PC has a Golden Tag that can be declared as a weakness for that roll.

> [!example]
#### Silver Tags
**Silver Tags increase or decrease the Stat Score** during a roll. Note that the Stat is not permanently changed. It merely is modified for the purposes of calculating if a roll succeeds or not.

>[!note] Effect on the possible Tier of Success
>Increasing a stat not only means that the roll is more likely to succeed. It also means that **the possible outcome might be a bigger number,** therefore resulting on a **bigger Tier of Success ($).**

> [!example]
> A PC with *Big Game Hunter T3* has to roll Awarenes to track a beast. Their AWA score is 3. The GM accepts the declared tag. Therefore, the roll must be a 6 or under to succeed.
> 
> The player rolls a 5. This result would be a fail with an unmodified AWA roll, but in this case, it is a success with 5$.

## Using Negative Tags
- Hinderances:
	- Always invoked: penalty
	- Not always invoked: invoking them gives luck / xp
