## Tags 101
> [!important] Tags in a nutshell
> Tags are **descriptive words or sentences used to reflect qualities** of objects, characters or the environment.
> 
> The **Type of Tag** describe how broadly can a Tag be applied.
> The **Metallic Colors** describe how powerful a Tag is.
> The **Pentachrome Colors** hint at the meaning of that tag in the context of a PC.

### Creation and Meaning
Tags are a **tool to be negotiated at the table**. The GM has the ultimate word about the existence or not of a tag.

A Tag may become well known within a group of players, cutting on the time it needs to be discussed because it has a **precedent on what it does and when it is used.**

> [!important] Polivalent Tags
> It is recomendable to create Tags in such a way that they can be declared both as a positive and negative character trait or scene element, depending on the context.

Tags can be permanent, like scars, wounds, classes, races, professions... or temporary, like environmental elements or temporary statuses.

Tags can be created during play:
 - An already established element can be referred to as a Tag.
 - A GM can draw attention to an element of the narrative by creating a Tag. 
 - Players can improvise Tags, GM permitting.
 - Status effects are also represented with tags.

> [!note] It can be useful to have index cards at hand to note Tags during play.

### Tier
> See [[tier-system]]

**Any Tag has an associated Tier**. The Tier represents the magnitude, size or difficulty to overcome, of the quality described by the Tag.

## Classes of Tag
> See [[tag-classes]]

The Class of a Tag defines how broadly can the Tag be applied.

| Class | Restriction                                    | Tier                                                                             |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Blank | Apply whenever possible. Just convince the GM. | Tier 1 by default. Usually Tier 1 or 2.                                          |
| Wild  | Apply whenever possible. Just convince the GM. | By default, low to mid Tier (2-3).                                               |
| Feat  | Apply only as specified by the Tag.            | The easier type of Tag to reach high Tier (4-6) without breaking the experience. |
- **Blank Tags** are generic Tags with **no custom rules.** They are the **weakest.**
- **Feat Tags have specific rules** associated to it, either because the ruleset specifies them or because those rules were created at the table.
- **Wild Tags are very powerful.** They are as **broad** as Blank Tags, but may have larger Tiers and refuse to be transformed into **Feat Tags.**

## Colors of Tags
> See [[tag-metallic-colors]], [[tag-pentachrome-colors]]
### Metallic Colors
Metallic Colors specify **how a Tag modifies a roll.**

| Color of tag | Roll modification                                   |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Golden       | Advantage / disadvantage                            |
| Silver       | Roll under Stat + Bonus (Bonus depends on Tag Tier) |
| Bronze       | Add $ after success ($ Tier equals Tag Tier)        |
- Bronze Tags **add the Tier of the Tag as a bonus or penalty to the Success Tier** of the roll.
- Golden Tags **allow for a roll to be done at Advantage /+/ or Disadvantage /-/.** The number of **/+/ or /-/ are equal to the Tier of the Tag.**
- **Silver Tags increase or decrease the Stat Score** during a roll.

### Pentachrome Colors
Pentachrome Colors can be used to describe Tags. That way, a player has a visual representation of how the Tags affect the personality of the PC.

## Using Negative Tags
> See [[pc-progression]]

A player **should always act according to the psychological Tags of their PC.** This is both for behaviors that give mechanical advantage to the PC, and those which put them in a bad position.

Playing them in this way allows for progression, and not doing so might mean the PC needs to be modified.
