# Movement Action
> See [[space-tiers]], [[combat]]

The **Movement Action specifies how moving works** in situations where **movement and positioning is critical** and the **action is played in moments**. This usually happens during combat, but not always.

Movement in combat is flexible and free-form. The focus of movement is for the PCs to think how they can gain advantages from the environment, avoid pitfalls, and use it as a tool itself. This means:
- Players and NPCs can easily obtain mechanical benefits from good ideas.
- Performing stunts is highly encouraged.

Moving is an action, and as such it can require a Check to perform. The [[space-tiers|Space Tiers]] are a good way to select a Tier for the Check in that case.

In the **typical Movement Action**, a PC can **move close**. What close means depends on the map. The important thing is to be consistent.

## Movement Check
Sometimes moving requires a Check. A movement can be specially daring or difficult. However, the main motivation as to have a Movement Check is to **gauge the effect of a movement action**. That is, how big of a stunt, or how bad of a crash a PC can have.

Success means benefitting from the movement

In some cases, the movement Check is required...
(getting away from temptation)

## Selecting a Stat
The player describes how the PC moves. This allows for any Movement Check to be done with any Physical or Mental [[pc-stats|Stat]], within limits.
