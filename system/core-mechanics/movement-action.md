# Movement Action
> See [[space-tiers]], [[combat]]

The **Movement Action specifies how moving works** in situations where **movement and positioning is critical** and the **action is played in moments**. This usually happens during combat, but not always.

In a regular movement action, a PC can move close. What close means depends on the map. The important thing is to be consistent.

Movement in combat is flexible and free-form. The focus of movement is for the PCs to think how they can gain advantages from the environment, avoid pitfalls, and use it as a tool itself. This means:
- Players and NPCs can easily obtain mechanical benefits from good ideas.
- Performing stunts is highly encouraged.

Moving is an action, and as such it can require a Check to perform. The [[space-tiers|Space Tiers]] are a good way to select a Tier for the Check in that case.
