# Tier Shifting
Shifting Tiers consists in **changing the Tier of a Tag for situations of difficulty or pressure.** It usually happens when a character takes action to modify the Tier of a Tag, but the mechanics of shifting tiers can be applied to other parts of the game.

## How to shift Tiers
The usual way to shift tiers is through [[rolling-dice|Checks or Tests]]. The Tier of Success ($) generated counts toward modifying.

> [!example] Example: PC repairing a machine
> A PC wants to repair a machine. The machine's status is defined by the *Broken, T3* Blank Tag.

The cost of Shifting Tiers equals the current Tier plus the next Tier. That cost is usually paid $, but not always. Some specific cases might double or divide the cost. If dividing, round up.


- Shifting tiers is also how you create or modify equipment. Also adding a negative tag, the cost of shifting the tier can be mitigated. Example: plasma pistol can be modified to add a custom tag "plasma cutter" so it can cut through materials. Adding a tier to "double-edged" (a property plasma weapons already have) makes the modification easier.

### Uses of Tier Shifting
> [!important] Why employing the Shifting Tiers mechanics?
> Shifting Tiers result in a more **granular** experience at creating or modifying Tags. Furthermore, Shifting Tiers **gets more difficult the higher the original Tier is.**

 Use the Shifting Tiers mechanics:
 - For parts of the game already written to use Tier Shifting.
 - For difficult actions.
 - To represent
