# Traits
> See [[tag-list]], [[tier-system]]

Traits are **Tags that don't directly affect the rolls.** Traits regulate other aspects of the game, like the requisites in order to use an item.

Like Tags, Traits use the [[tier-system|Tier System]].

## Requirement Traits
A Trait can represent a requisite proportional to the Tier.
- The encumbrance of an [[items-loadout-encumbrance|Item]] is always a Requirement Trait Tag, in this case, needing a number of inventory slots. It is usually obviated when the weight is 1.

> [!example] Example: The *Heavy* Trait in items
>  Heavy T2 means the item takes 2 inventory slots and it requires 40 str m√≠nimum to use.

### Stat Requirement
The most typical example of a Requirement Trait is one that specifies a minimum [[pc-stats|Stat]] score. The minimum Stat required is equal to the Tier of the Trait.

List of Stat Requirement Tags

| Trait     | Required Stat    |
| --------- | ---------------- |
| [[heavy]] | [[strength]]     |
|           | [[dexterity]]    |
|           | [[constitution]] |
|           | [[awareness]]    |
|           | [[intelligence]] |
|           | [[willpower]]       |


### Tag Requirement
Tag requirement: The required tag must be equal or higher to the tag.

### Other cases
#### Cumulative Requirement
In some cases, an additional word is added to a Tag: Cumulative.
This means that, if more than one item with the same tag is held, it requires +1$ after the first "item" with the tag i.e.: heavy

#### Leveling up
Training with a trainer increases a stat a number of points equal to Tier x d5 (d4?) of the trainer. The trainer is strictly necessary to increase a stat (except from healing?).
