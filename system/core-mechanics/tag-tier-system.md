# Tag & Tier System
## Tags 101
> [!important] Tags are descriptive words or sentences used to reflect qualities of objects, characters or the environment.
> Types of Tag describe how broadly can they be applied
> Colors describe how powerful they are.

Tags are a tool to be negotiated on a table, and a group of players will get used to their custom tags. The GM has the ultimate word about the existence or not of a tag.

Tags can be permanent, like scars, wounds, classes, races, proffesions...

Tags can be created during play:
 - An already established element can be referred to as a Tag.
 - A GM can draw attention to an element of the narrative by creating a Tag. 
 - Players can propose Tags.
 - Status effects are also represented with tags.

> [!note] It can be useful to have index cards at hand to note Tags during play.
## Tier 101
Any Tag has a tier associated with it. The Tier represents the magnitude, size or difficulty of the quality described by the Tag.
- It is specified as T#.
- Tier typically ranges from 1 to 5, but can be more.
- Also, there are negative tags, i.e.: reliability.
- Some tags have no tier: Petty (item) is a Tier 0 tag for infinitely stackable items.
- [[space-time-visibility-cost-connections]] use tiers
# Types of Tag

| Type  | Restriction                                        | Power                |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Blank | Apply whenever possible. Just convince the GM.     | Usually Tier 1       |
| Wild  | Apply whenever possible. Just convince the GM.     | Usually a low Tier   |
| Feat  | Apply only in the situations specified by the Tag. | Can reach high Tiers |

## Blank Tags (Basic Tags)
Blank Tags are generic Tags with no mechanics associated to them:
- The use of Blank Tags is negotiated at the table, with the GM having the last word.
- They can be employed both in favor and against the PCs.
- Blank Tags are flexible because they don't have specific mechanics or use cases.
- When a Tag is created, it usually is a Blank Tag.
- A Blank Tag is usually Tier 1, especially when it applies to PCs (and not the environment).

A tag can be Blank and Silver, or Blank and Gold at the same time.
## Feats
> [!note] Setting Precedents
> A Tag may become well known within a group of players. Therefore, the Tag doesn't need much discussion because it has a **precedent on what it does and when it is used.**

A **Feat is a Tag which has specific rules** associated to it, either because the ruleset specifies them or because those rules were created at the table.

> [!example] Example of Tags becoming Feats:
> Imagine a character with the White Tag *Happy Trigger Finger.*
> 
> The player always declares this tag when entering combat, to add $ to their initiative.
> 
> After a few sessions, the GM might decide to standardize this Tag into a Feat. By declaring the tag as a Tier 2, the player always adds 2$ to the initiative rolls, but at the same time, they loose the opportunity to use the tag to gain any other mechanical advantage.
### Other colors of Feat
A Feat uses the color Bronze in its most basic form, although any other color might be used to better separate groups of Feats. Consider any tag a Feat if it is not Blank nor Wild.

In addition, Silver or Golden tags might or might not be Feats. Silver and Gold are colors that speak to the specific mechanics of the tag, and might be combined with any other color a Feat tag has.

## Wild Tags (Anti-feats)
Wild Tags are very powerful tags because they refuse to be transformed into Feats:
> [!important] The Anti- Feat
> A Black Tag is a Tag that **can be applied in any way, shape or form if it is negotiated** as such at the table, and the **GM gives their approval.**
> 
> The Black Tag **keeps functioning as an open-ended, negotiable Tag always,** and **never becomes a Feat** with a determined mechanic associated to its use.

- A Tag can be created as a Wild Tag, or it can become Wild at any point.
- Wild Tags are rewarded by the GM and are created by GM fiat.
- Players should only have 1 to 3 Wild tags, including in their equipment.
- Wild tags should be somewhat specific.
- Ideally, a Wild tag should be as easy to invoke against the PC as it is to use in his favor.

> [!example] Example of Wild Tags:
> Imagine the previous character, with the Blank Tag *Happy Trigger Finger*.
> 
> Instead of transforming the Blank Tag into a Feat, the GM might reward the player's interesting uses of the Tag - and their acceptance of the bad consequences of having too happy of a trigger finger.
> 
> Therefore, the Tag is transformed into a Wild Tag:
> - Mechanically, it is weaker in some specific cases. For example, it keeps adding only 1$ to Initiative rolls.
> - It is a Tag with great usability both in favor and against the PC.
> - The player can be as creative as he wants when using the tag. As long as the idea is accepted by the rest of the players and the GM gives the green light, *Happy Trigger Finger* can be employed in situations where it is fitting, outside the obvious ones.

A Wild Tag can be Wild and Golden, or Wild and Silver, at the same time. 
# Uses of Tags
## Tags and rolls
There are several ways a Tag can affect a Check or a Test. It is always important to keep in mind that it is possible to invoke a Tag both in favor and against a PC's roll.

| Type of tag | Roll mechanic                                       |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Golden      | Advantage / disadvantage                            |
| Silver      | Roll under Stat + Bonus (Bonus depends on Tag Tier) |
| Any other   | Add $ after success ($ Tier equals Tag Tier)        |
### The standard use
The most basic way to use a Tag is to **add the Tier off the Tag as a bonus or penalty to the Success Tier** of the roll (see [[rolling-dice]]).

> [!danger] This means that Tags generally only affect Successful Rolls.
> It is interesting to declare a Tag being used before a roll. But it is better to wait for the full negotiation of a difficult to apply Tag until after the roll is successful. It might not even matter.

> [!example]
> A player declares: *I attack stupidly.*
> Only after succeeding the attack roll, the pertinent discussion about the Tag "stupid" is held.
> 
> If the players like it, and the GM accepts it, *Stupid T2* adds + 2$ to the successful roll.
> 
> More likely, the GM might declare a penalty of -2$ to the roll.
### Metal Color Tags
There are other two ways a Tag can affect the procedures of a roll. The two special cases are codified with the Golden and Silver metallic colors.

> [!important] Polivalent Metal Tags
> Especially in the case of Metal Tags, it is recomendable to create Tags in such a way that they can be declared both as positive and negative character trait.

The two Metal Tags are very powerful, so they are usually Feats. Therefore, using them falls under very specific situations.

> [!info] Metallic color + Feat color
> It is usual that a Golden or Silver tag is combined with a color different than the Bronze base color for the feats. In these cases, the metallic and non-metallic colors coexist.

> [!danger] Open-ended Metal Tags
> It is possible to have Golden or Silver Tag colors **combined with either Blank or Wild Tags.**
> 
> This **combination leads to incredibly powerful tags,** because the use case of Non-Feat tags is very broad, and in any of those cases, the incredible benefits of Metal tags are triggered.
> 
> It is also dangerous for players to have Metal Tags that can be easily employed as **negative Tags.**
#### Golden Tags
Golden Tags **allow for a roll to be done at Advantage /+/ or Disadvantage /-/.**
- The number of **/+/ or /-/ are equal to the Tier of the Tag.**
- Determining if a roll done by a PC is at advantage or disadvantage is simple:
	- /+/ if the PC benefits from one of his Golden Tags.
	- /+/ if the player exploits a Golden Tag that is considered a weakness of someone or something outside the PC.
	- /-/ if the Golden Tag is used against the PC.
	- /-/ if the PC has a Golden Tag that can be declared as a weakness for that roll.

> [!example]
#### Silver Tags
Silver Tags add or subtract points to a Stat before rolling.
> [!example]

## Requirement Tags
A tag can represent a requisite proportional to the Tier.
- The encumbrance of an [[items-loadout-encumbrance|Item]] is always a Requirement Tag, in this case, needing a number of inventory slots. It is usually obviated when the weight is 1.

> [!example] Example: The *Heavy* Tag in items
>  Heavy T2 means the item takes 2 inventory slots and it requires 40 str m√≠nimum to use.

### Stat Requirement
The most typical example of a Requirement Tag is one that specifies a minimum [[pc-stats|Stat]] score.

| Tier of the Tag | Minimum Stat | Minimum Status Stat |
| --------------- | ------------ | ------------------- |
| 0               | 33           | 3                   |
| 1               | 44           | 4                   |
| 2               | 55           | 5                   |
| 3               | 66           | 6                   |
| 4               | 77           | 7                   |
| 5               | 88           | 8                   |
| 6               | 99           | 9                   |
List of Requirement Tags

| Requirement Tag | Required Stat    |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| [[heavy]]       | [[Strength]]     |
|                 | [[Dexterity]]    |
|                 | [[Constitution]] |
|                 | [[Awareness]]    |
|                 | [[Intelligence]] |
|                 | [[Wisdom]]       |

### Tag Requirement
Tag requirement: The required tag must be equal or higher to the tag.
### Other cases
#### Cumulative Requirement
In some cases, an additional word is added to a Tag: Cumulative.
This means that, if more than one item with the same tag is held, it requires +1$ after the first "item" with the tag i.e.: heavy
#### Leveling up
Training with a trainer increases a stat a number of points equal to Tier x d5 (d4?) of the trainer. The trainer is strictly necessary to increase a stat (except from healing?).
## Using Negative Tags
- Hinderances:
	- Always invoked: penalty
	- Not always invoked: invoking them gives luck / xp
## Shifting tiers
Making effects or statuses increase or decrease in tier:
- To make an effect go down might be needed a Tag with the same Tier (and a successful roll)
- Use the tier list from place of thing?
- Use the change move from place of thng as a reference of how much a tier drops
- Shifting tiers is also how you create or modify equipment. Also adding a negative tag, the cost of shifting the tier can be mitigated. Example: plasma pistol can be modified to add a custom tag "plasma cutter" so it can cut through materials. Adding a tier to "double-edged" (a property plasma weapons already have) makes the modification easier.
