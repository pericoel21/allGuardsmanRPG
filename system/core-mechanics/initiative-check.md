# Initiative Check
In some situations the **Order of Play of the characters matters**. This is the case of a combat, but other situations might require structure too.

> [!example] Examples of situations where Initiative Checks are required:
> - Combat, of course.
> - A trap goes off. The Initiative Check tells if PCs can dodge it.
> - In a verbal conflict: The Initiative roll can mediate situations where the player says something cool, but too late, or to let the player think for longer to represent a cool comeback the PC has.

The **GM has either one or Turns each Round**.
- **First GM Turn**: **Regular turn**, used for enemies, traps, etc.
- **Second GM Turn**: Can be used to **divide large amounts of enemies in two Turns** or to **play environmental factors**. The second turn is always **towards the end of Round**.

The Order of Play in this type of situations is **determined by the Initiative Check**. The check is performed against the Initiative of one of the enemies.

> [!tip] Selecting the Tier of Initiative
> The **GM can choose the Tier of the Initiative** stat of any enemy, and that will be the Tier of the Initiative Check. 
> 
> However, it is **recommended to choose highest** Initiative Tier of any enemy in the combat.

If a given PC **succeeds on the Initiative Check, they go before the first GM's Turn**, that is, before any enemy. If they **fail, they go after the first GM Turn** and before the second one.

A **Fumble** puts the PC **after the second GM round**, and still makes them roll on a fumble table.

Thus, the Rounds are ordered this way:

| Order | Who goes?                                                   |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1st   | **PCs who succeed** the Initiative Check.                   |
| 2nd   | Regular **GM Turn**. Enemies, traps...                      |
| 3rd   | **PCs who fail** the initiative Check **without Fumbling**. |
| 4th   | **GM Turn**. More enemies, environment.                     |
| 5th   | **PCs who Fumbled** on the Initiative roll.                 |
