# Combat
> [!info] See [[social-conflict]], [[hit-points]], [[pain-wounds]]

In this page rules for combat are explained. It is possible to translate the same rules to structure a conflict of social nature.
## Turn order in combat
> [!info] See [[order-of-play]]

A combat round is measured in Moments, and to determine the order of play, an Initiative roll is required:

| Order | Who goes?                                                   |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1st   | **PCs who succeed** the Initiative Check.                   |
| 2nd   | Regular **GM Turn**. Enemies, traps...                      |
| 3rd   | **PCs who fail** the initiative Check **without Fumbling**. |
| 4th   | **GM Turn**. More enemies, environment.                     |
| 5th   | **PCs who Fumbled** on the Initiative roll.                 |

## Actions
> [!info] See [[space-tiers]], [[movement-action]], [[attack-check]], [[trickshots]], [[aiming]], [[attack-check]], [[pain-wounds]]

In Combat, a PC can do two actions on each of their turns. They can choose from the following four options, and they can repeat the same option twice:
### Movement
- Move **up to Close**.
- Using the **Movement intelligently or dynamically** might translate into **bonuses**.
- A **Movement Roll** might be needed.
- A **bad positioning or a failed Movement Roll** might impose **penalties**.

### Basic Attacks
- The **Tier of the Check** is the **Toughness of the enemy**.
- The **Tier of Success** is the **Damage** applied.
- Enemy's Pain and Wounds work like in PCs.

### Trickshot
- **Attack made to an specific part of the target, or in a very specific way.**
- The intent could just be to **make more damage**.
- A Trickshot can also be used to **hinder** the enemy, imposing **Tags**.

### Aiming
- **Upgrades a future attack**.
- To aim, a PC performs a **Test** where they **accumulate successes** that influence the next attack.
- Although any stat can be used in theory, **[[awareness|Awareness]] is employed most of the time**, with a second usual Stat being [[intelligence|Intelligence]].

### Initiative Check
- The first initiative Check, at the beginning of the combat, doesn't count as an action,

## Defending from an Attack
> See [[defense-check]], [[hit-points]], [[pain-wounds]]

Process of defending:
1. **Describe what the PC does to defend**
   This determines the [[pc-stats|Stat]] used to defend, and might also give penalties or bonuses.
2. **Roll defense**
   Roll under the selected stat, applying tags and other modifiers (like [[cover]])
3. **Subtract $ from the damage**
   The damage comes from the weapon used. Subtract from it the $ generated in the [[defense-check]].
4. **Take the damage**
   The damage that you didn't get to reduce now is subtracted from your [[hit-points]]. If you reach 0, it doesn't carry over.
5. **Take a Wound** 
   If your [[hit-points]] are 0 and you take more damage, take a [[pain-wounds|Wound]]. Tier = damage.
