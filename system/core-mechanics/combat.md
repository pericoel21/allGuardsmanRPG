# Combat
> See [[social-conflict]]

Movement and positioning is relevant in combat too. (No static combat like 5e)

## Ranges & movement
> See [[space-tiers]]



## Attacking
> See [[attack-check]], [[hit-points]], [[wounds]]

### Basic Attacks
The Attack Check is done exactly the same way as any other check:
- The Tier of the Check is the Toughness of the enemy.
- The Tier of Success is the Damage applied.

Enemies have Hit Points. When they are reduced to 0 by the Damage of the attacks, the enemy rolls for a Wound.

### Called Shots


## Defending from an Attack
> See [[defense-check]], [[hit-points]], [[wounds-health-recovery]]

Process of defending:
1. **Describe what the PC does to defend**
   This determines the [[pc-stats|Stat]] used to defend, and might also give penalties or bonuses.
2. **Roll defense**
   Roll under the selected stat, applying tags and other modifiers (like [[cover]])
3. **Subtract $ from the damage**
   The damage comes from the weapon used. Subtract from it the $ generated in the [[defense-check]].
4. **Take the damage**
   The damage that you didn't get to reduce now is subtracted from your [[hit-points]]. If you reach 0, it doesn't carry over.
5. **Take a Wound** 
   If your [[hit-points]] are 0 and you take more damage, take a [[wounds-health-recovery|Wound]]. Tier = damage.

## Handling Fumbles and Crits
> See [[crits-fumbles]]

A critical defense roll can also be a fumble in the attack.
