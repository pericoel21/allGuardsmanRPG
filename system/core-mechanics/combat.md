# Combat
Dodge roll + dmg reduction
Movement and positioning is relevant in combat too. (No static combat like 5e)

Defend with any stat: (only physicals)?
- STR: parry, block or tank
- DEX: dodge, parry or gamble
- CON: poison, block, tank
- AWA: dodge
- WIS: dodge
- INT: dodge, parry


Weapon tags can specify which stat cannot defend against that weapon.

A critical defense roll can also be a fumble in the attack.

## The Defense Roll
When a PC is attacked by an enemy, a Defense Roll is required to determine if the attack lands or misses.

### Selecting a Stat
The player describes how the PC handles the defense. This allows for any Defense Roll to be done with any Physical or Mental [[pc-stats|Stat]], within limits.

> [!info] A good rule of thumb
> Typically, a Physical attack will be handled by a Physical stat, and viceversa for Mental attacks and stats. The only clear exception is using awareness to dodge.

> [!important] Freedom for the GM
> The next table is useful if a GM wants to really regulate how defending works in the system.
> 
> However, the idea is for players to be reasonable in their arguing. Therefore, a GM should feel free to impose penalties as they see fit when a player's idea is too out there.

### Penalties & bonuses
A GM will impose **penalties**:
- For situations where **defending is difficult** even if the selected stat is a good idea.
- For situations where the selected stat doesn't make a lot of sense.

A defense roll can have bonuses:
- If the PC is in cover while defending from a ranged attack.
- If the PC has [[tags|Tags]] that give some sort of defense.
### Handling a Hit
Process of defending:
1. Roll defense.
2. Subtract $ from the damage.
3. Take the damage into the hit points. Damage doesn't carry over.
4. If armor is 0 when attacked, take a wound with tier = damage (roll on the weapon's table or in a generic table)
