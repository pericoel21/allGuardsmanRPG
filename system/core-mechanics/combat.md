# Combat
> See [[social-conflict]], [[hit-points]], [[pain-wounds]]


## Turn order in combat
determine turn order (initiative) each round

## Actions
> See [[space-tiers]], [[movement-action]], [[attack-check]], [[trickshots]], [[aiming]], [[attack-check]]


### Movement

### Basic Attacks
- The Tier of the Check is the Toughness of the enemy. The Tier of Success is the damage applied. Pain and wounds work like in PCs

### Trickshot
**Attack made to an specific part of the target, or in a very specific way.** The intent could just be to **make more damage,** but a Trickshot can also be used to **hinder** the enemy.

### Aiming
**Upgrades a future attack**.
To aim, a PC performs a **Test** where they **accumulate successes** that influence the next attack.

Although any stat can be used in theory, **[[awareness|Awareness]] is employed most of the time**, with a second usual Stat being [[intelligence|Intelligence]].

### Initiative Check
An [[initiative-check|Initiative Check]] is performed at the start of some situations like combat, to determine the Order of Play, but more can be done to better the position of a specific PC.

## Defending from an Attack
> See [[defense-check]], [[hit-points]], [[pain-wounds]]

Process of defending:
1. **Describe what the PC does to defend**
   This determines the [[pc-stats|Stat]] used to defend, and might also give penalties or bonuses.
2. **Roll defense**
   Roll under the selected stat, applying tags and other modifiers (like [[cover]])
3. **Subtract $ from the damage**
   The damage comes from the weapon used. Subtract from it the $ generated in the [[defense-check]].
4. **Take the damage**
   The damage that you didn't get to reduce now is subtracted from your [[hit-points]]. If you reach 0, it doesn't carry over.
5. **Take a Wound** 
   If your [[hit-points]] are 0 and you take more damage, take a [[pain-wounds|Wound]]. Tier = damage.
