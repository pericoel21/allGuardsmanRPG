# Combat
Dodge roll + dmg reduction
Movement and positioning is relevant in combat too. (No static combat like 5e)

Defend with any stat: (only physicals)?
- STR: parry, block or tank
- DEX: dodge, parry or gamble
- CON: poison, block, tank
- AWA: dodge
- WIS: dodge
- INT: dodge, parry


Weapon tags can specify which stat cannot defend against that weapon.

A critical defense roll can also be a fumble in the attack.
