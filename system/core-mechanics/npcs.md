# Non-Player Characters & Enemies
Any character who is **not directly controlled by the players** counts as the same type of entity, an NPC. Some NPCs can be commanded by PCs and they are called *Hirelings*.

NPCs have an even more simplified set of Stats than the players to make them easier to run in numbers - either for the GM or for players with Hirelings. The intent behind the design of NPCs is to simplify the decision making when interpreting those characters.

## Stats
NPC Stats are used both for players to roll under them, if they are controlling hirelings, and for enemies to impose Check and Test Tiers.

| Combat     | Physical Stats | Mental Stats | Status Stats                                        |
| ---------- | -------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| [[melee]]  | [[toughness]]  | [[instinct]] | [[morale]]                                          |
| [[ranged]] | [[agility]]    | [[whit]]     | [[pain-wounds]] |

- **Combat Stats**: Used for anything combat: [[melee]] for close quarters combat, and [[ranged]] for the use of guns or projectiles.
- **Physical Stats**: It is usual that they function more like saves, but not always.
- **Mental Stats**: Also used many times as saves. Important for social play, combined with tags.
- **Status Stats**: Define how much enemies keep fighting, how NPCs react to PCs, and how much hirelings follow their leaders.
- **Pain**: Damage an NPC can take before taking a wound
- **Wounds**: The main distinction between types of enemies is the number of Wounds they can take before dying.

## Tags & NPC Tiers
> See [[tags]]

NPCs get Tags too. Their functionality is the same as in PCs, but they are presented in very specific way: The intent is as much mechanical as narrative. The way that NPC tags are displayed makes it very simple to understand and play an NPC.

The NPCs also follow the Tier system, where if a Tier is needed for any roll or other circumstance, that number is used.

### Nicknames & NPC Tier
Most intelligent NPCs and many famous beasts get a nickname. The **Nickname is part of their name**, but it can also be invoked as a **Silver Wild Tag**. **The Tier of that Nickname Wild Tag is the Tier of the NPC itself**. 

> [!example] Examples of NPC Nicknames
> The following names show how an enemy or NPC name would be presented, and how a GM could use their name as a Wild Tag.
> *Rot-Teeth Rats, T2*
> This pack of rats could do a T1 attack invoking *Rot-Teeth* (the defense roll would need 2$)
> 
> *Speed Freak, T3*
> Hitting this guy when riding full speed is a Check Tier 3.
> 
> *Frail Sorcerer, T2*
> Note that *Frail* is a Tag that can be used against the NPC very easily. In that situation, players would have a T2 Tag at their favor.
> 
> *Dirty Bandit, T1*
> Besides his nickname, the T1 means that any other generic action the bandit attempts will possibly be T1 at most. Also, knowing that T1 is interesting as a number to check against if players attempt anything not stipulated by the Stats.

### Description
NPCs have a short description. Any word **written in italics and capitalized** is meant to be used as a Bronze Tag with the same Tier as the Nickname.

> [!example]
> The following is an NPC with his name, nickname and description:
> > *Frail Sorcerer, T2*
> > *Spiritual Guide* and *Cultist* of the *Marrow Eaters Cult* specialized in *Bone Telekinesis*. Can use a *Dagger* if cornered. *Weird* combination of *Bookworm* but *Sadistic*.

### Specific Tags
More tags for the NPCs can be explicitly written, and the Tier might differ from the one specified with the Nickname. In this case, tags are written the same way they do in PCs.

## Types of NPCs
### Mooks
Mooks are the **default way of representing characters**, including enemies, friendly NPCs, hirelings...

A Mook can be an enemy or not. But there are several [[tag-list|Feats]] which create special types of Mook:
#### Hirelings
Hirelings are NPCs hired or convinced by PCs to act as a member of the party.
- **Players have their sheets and roll their dice**. Checks and Tests performed by Mooks are rolls under that NPC's stat.
- The **GM interprets them** and has veto over their actions.
- Morale rolls are used to determine if Mooks follow the PCs in extreme situations.
- Hirelings get a morale modifier by PCs using [[connections]] or [[wealth]].

#### Swarms & Crowds
> See [[crowd-swarm]]

Crowds and Swarms are **groups of weak NPCs represented as a single character** for ease of use. They have a **single statblock** and perform a **single action** per turn.

The Swarm or Crowd uniqueness resides on the meaning of the Enemy Tier: in their case, the **Tier always equals the number of spare Wounds** they have. 

### Basic NPCs
Many NPCs **might need to be interacted with, but will not fight** against the PCs. Technically this type of NPC can be any other type, like a Mook. The distinction between a Basic NPC and the others is the **amount of information** needed to describe them:
- **Stats might not be needed.** For basic social rolls, the PC might just roll against the Tier of the NPC or that of any relevant Tag.
- A description might be useful, but for especially basic NPCs, a **name and nickname might be enough**.

(WIP)
### Archenemies & Heroes
(Do I need them?)
> See [[pc-stats]], [[pc-creation]]

Archenemies and Heroes are NPCs so  A Swarm or Crowd that they deserve a **full PC statblock**. Although the Stats are the same in name, their use is as the Tier of Checks or Tests, like in the case of any other enemy.

## NPCs and order of play
Beat the instinct of an NPC to go before. NPCs go on their instinc's order and at the endo of the round
