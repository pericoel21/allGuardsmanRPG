# Tier 101
> See [[tag-list]], [[feats]]

**Any Tag or Feat has an associated Tier**. The Tier represents the magnitude, size or difficulty of the quality described by the Tag.
- It is specified as *T#* (# being a number).
- Tier typically ranges from 1 to 6, but it can be more.
- Also, there are negative tags. I.e.: reliability becomes unreliability if it is less than 1.
- Some tags have no tier: Petty (item) is a Tier 0 tag for infinitely stackable items.
- [[space-time-visibility-cost-connections]] use tiers.
## Shifting tiers
Making effects or statuses increase or decrease in tier:
- To make an effect go down might be needed a Tag with the same Tier (and a successful roll)
- Use the tier list from place of thing?
- Use the change move from place of thng as a reference of how much a tier drops
- Shifting tiers is also how you create or modify equipment. Also adding a negative tag, the cost of shifting the tier can be mitigated. Example: plasma pistol can be modified to add a custom tag "plasma cutter" so it can cut through materials. Adding a tier to "double-edged" (a property plasma weapons already have) makes the modification easier.
