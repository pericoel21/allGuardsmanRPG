# Tier System
> See [[tag-list]], [[traits]]

## Tier 101
**Any Tag or Feat has an associated Tier**. The Tier represents the magnitude, size or difficulty of the quality described by the Tag.
- It is specified as *T#* after the name of the Tag (# being a number).
- Tier typically ranges from 1 to 6, but it can be more.
- Also, there are negative Tiers.
  > [!example] 
  > *Reliability* becomes *Unreliability* if it is less than Tier 1.
- Some tags have no tier.
  > [!example]
  > *Petty* (for an item) is a Tier 0 tag for infinitely stackable items.

> [!info] Some concepts measured in Tiers:
> [[space-tiers|Space]], [[time-tiers|Time]], [[cost-tiers]], [[vision-tiers|Vision]], [[social-standing-tiers|Social Standing]]

## Modifying Tiers
A Tag's Tier may be changed because it makes narrative sense and the table agrees.
> [!example] Examples of Tier modification are:
> - PCs changing circumstances of the environment that are defined as a Tag.
> - [[pc-progression]] can happen in a way that modifies the Tier of player Tags.
> - [[wounds-health-recovery|Wounds]] are recovered if their Tier is reduced to 0.

Modifying the tier can happen in two ways: Modifying the Tier directly, or through [[tier-shifting]].
### Direct modification
The Tier of a Tag **changes from one number to another,** without any other mechanical implication.

This is a catch-all way to modfy Tier, and it should be the default because it is the simplest one.
### Tier Shifting
> See [[tier-shifting]]

Shifting the Tier of a Tag is a Tier modification method that complicates the process a bit for the PCs, so it should be used sparingly.

Use Tier Shifting when it is more fun to play the slow process of changing the Tag because that Tag represents something important in the narrative.

When Shifting Tiers, there is a **cost**. It is usually **paid in Tiers of Success ($)**.
> [!tip] Cost of Tier Shifting
> When going from *Tier X* to *Tier Y*, the cost is $X + Y$, usually in Tiers of Success ($) of a roll.
