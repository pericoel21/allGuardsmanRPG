# Non-Player Characters & Enemies
> [!info] NPCs in a nutshell
> Any character that is not directly controlled by the players counts as the same type of entity, an NPC. Some NPCs can be commanded by PCs and they are called Hirelings.
>
> They have an even more simplified set of Stats than the players to make them easier to run in numbers.
> 
> The way NPCs are designed is intended to make some of the decision making more easier when interpreting those characters, both for the GM and the Players.

- Morale system
- Simplified stats. Instinct.
- Stats are used both to roll for them (hirelings) and to defend from them (enemies)
- NPCs get a name with a nickname that can be used as a blank tag
- NPCs might get more tags
- Do NPCs get corruption?

## Stats

| Combat     | Physical Stats | Mental Stats | Status Stats |
| ---------- | -------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| [[melee]]  | [[toughness]]  | [[instinct]] | [[morale]]   |
| [[ranged]] | [[agility]]    | [[whit]]     | [[health]]   |

### Combat Stats
Used for anything combat: [[melee]] for close quarters combat, and [[ranged]] for the use of guns or projectiles.
### Physical Stats
It is usual that they function more like saves, but not always.
### Mental Stats
Also used many times as saves.
Also important for social (combined with tags)
### Status Stats
Define how much enemies keep fighting, how NPCs react to PCs, and how much hirelings follow.
[[health]] is both physical and mental

## Hirelings
- Players have their sheets and roll their dice, but the GM interprets them and has veto over their actions.
- Hirelings get a morale modifier by PCs using [[connections]] or [[wealth]]
## Arch-Enemies
They have the same stats as the player, but still used as a player facing roll.
