# Metallic Colors in Tags
Metallic Colors specify **how a Tag modifies a roll.** 

| Color of tag | Roll modification                                   |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Golden       | Advantage / disadvantage                            |
| Silver       | Roll under Stat + Bonus (Bonus depends on Tag Tier) |
| Bronze       | Add $ after success ($ Tier equals Tag Tier)        |
It is always important to keep in mind that it is possible to invoke a Tag both in favor and against a PC's roll.

> [!info] Metallic Colors & Types of Tags
> Note that any Metallic Color (Silver, Bronze, Gold) can be combined with any type of Tag (Blank, Wild, Feat).

> [!important] Power of the Tag depends on Metallic Color
> Golden Tags are much more powerful than the other two Colors. And Silver Tags are more powerful than Bronze Tags.
> 
> It is recommended to use Bronze as the default color for Blank Tags, and from there, increase their power if the Tag feels underwhelming.
> 
> Be very careful creating Gold Wild Tags. That said, Gold Wild Tags can define an interesting and entertaining PC.
## Bronze Tags
Bronze Tags **add the Tier of the Tag as a bonus or penalty to the Success Tier** of the roll (see [[rolling-dice]]).


> [!danger] This means that Bronze Tags only affect Successful Rolls.
> It is interesting to declare the narrative relevance of a Bronze Tag in the context of a roll. 
> 
> But it is better to wait for the full negotiation of a difficult to apply Bronze Tag until after the roll is successful. It might not even matter, if the roll fails.

> [!example]
> A PC has the Tag *Stupid T2* (a Bronze Tag). The player declares: *I attack stupidly.*
> 
> Only after succeeding the attack roll, the pertinent discussion about the Tag *Stupid* is held.
> 
> If the players like it, and the GM accepts it, *Stupid T2* adds + 2$ to the successful roll.
> 
> More likely, the GM might declare a penalty of -2$ to the roll.

## Golden Tags
Golden Tags **allow for a roll to be done at Advantage /+/ or Disadvantage /-/.**
- The number of **/+/ or /-/ are equal to the Tier of the Tag.**
- Determining if a roll done by a PC is at advantage or disadvantage is simple:
	- /+/ if the PC benefits from one of his Golden Tags.
	- /+/ if the player exploits a Golden Tag that is considered a weakness of someone or something outside the PC.
	- /-/ if the Golden Tag is used against the PC.
	- /-/ if the PC has a Golden Tag that can be declared as a weakness for that roll.

> [!example]
## Silver Tags
**Silver Tags increase or decrease the Stat Score** during a roll. Note that the Stat is not permanently changed. It merely is modified for the purposes of calculating if a roll succeeds or not.

>[!note] Effect on the possible Tier of Success
>Increasing a stat not only means that the roll is more likely to succeed. It also means that **the possible outcome might be a bigger number,** therefore resulting on a **bigger Tier of Success ($).**

> [!example]
> A PC with *Big Game Hunter T3* has to roll Awarenes to track a beast. Their AWA score is 3. The GM accepts the declared tag. Therefore, the roll must be a 6 or under to succeed.
> 
> The player rolls a 5. This result would be a fail with an unmodified AWA roll, but in this case, it is a success with 5$.
