# Critical Successes
> See [[rolling-dice]], [[tier-system]], [[pc-stats]]

> [!important] Critical Success in a nutshell
> A **Critical Roll** is a roll where the **natural die result equals the maximum result possible**.

> [!tip] Natural Rolls, modified Stats
> When determining if the outcome of a roll is a Critical, we **check the result of the dice without applying any modification** - modifications like extra Tiers of Success.
> 
> In the case of **Crits**, we check the **natural roll against the modified Stat** - that is, the base Stat plus any modifier to the roll.

## Determining Crits
When performing a [[rolling-dice|Check]] or a [[rolling-dice|Test]], the **roll is made against a Stat that can be modified or not**. In order to **succeed** that roll, the **maximum possible outcome equals that modified stat** - any more and the roll is a failure.

> Any roll where the **natural die result equals the modified Stat is a Critical Roll**.

> [!example] Example of a Crit
> A PC is rolling a [[strength|Strength]] Check. His **[[strength|STR]] Tier is 5** and a **Tier 2 Silver Tag applies** to the roll. Therefore, **the PC must roll a 7 or less** to succeed.
> 
> > If **the PC rolls a 7** on the d12 die, the Check not only **succeeds**, but it is considered a **Critical**.
> 
> Note that **any result below 7 is a success but not a critical**, because the maximum natural roll that can be successful in this case is 7. This includes rolling a 5, which in other situations might be a critical - The PC's STR Tier is 5 unmodified.

### Expanded Crit Range
Some [[tag-classes|Feat Tags]] might apply a condition called **Expanded Critical Range**. If the **conditions stipulated by the Feat** are met, the PC might **consider any natural 1 roll a Critical**, in addition to the regular Criticals.

## Effect of a Crit
> See [[tier-die|Tier Dice]]

When the outcome of a roll is a Critical, the **Tier of Success is calculated as usual**. Then, a **bonus** is added to the Tier of Success by **rolling the [[luck|Luck]] [[pc-stats|Stat]]'s [[tier-die|Tier Die]]**.

> [!example] Continuing with the previous example...
> The PC has **rolled a Critical with a Tier of Success of 7**. The PC has a **Luck Stat of 2**, so he rolls the associated **Tier Die**, in this case, a **d6**. The **result** of that d6 roll **is a 2, and he adds it to the previous 7$**.
> 
> > The **resulting** *Tier of Success* of the STR roll **is 9\$**.
