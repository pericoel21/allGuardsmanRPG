# Tier Die
> See [[tier-system]], [[tags]], [[criticals]]

Some mechanics, like [[criticals|Crits & Fumbles]] or [[tag-classes|Feat Tags]] use dice rolls to represent benefits or detriments, specially to modify the Tier of Success of a roll. For this, the Tier Dice Chain is used. It makes a relation between a Tier and a die or dice combination.
