# Items, Loadout & Encumbrance
 Item creation and modification: uses [[system/core-mechanics/tags|tier]] modification rules.
		- Adding tags
		- Negative tags make modification easier / cheaper

Encumbrance: Assault gear vs backpacking gear. PCs are doing a mission. They carry little equipment, the only needed for that specific mission. Loadout sequence at the beginning

Items: default are bronze tags
Petty items too? Or are those silver by default?
- Petty items = quantic inventory. In the party sheet: unlocked for the whole party.
