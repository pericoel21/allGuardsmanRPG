# Player Character Creation
## How PCs work
This system has a few interesting concepts about the way it handles Player characters.

> [!info] The style of characters
> This system is mainly intended for players to run human or abhuman characters in a cool, grimdark, science fantasy setting.
> 
> The PCs are not very powerful at the beginning and they don't progress to heroic levels easily. Nonetheless, they can be resourceful and three-dimensional from the get-go.

> [!important] The compromise to play the character
> When a player creates their Character, they should feel like they can play out their actions and their consequences.
> 
> By accepting to do so, the player is contracting a compromise with the rest of the player and the GM: anybody should be able to invoke the negative aspects of the character, and to bring up situations which difficult their life.
> 
> This is important because if a player is not comfortable with embodying a character with a specific flaw or vice, it is better to create other character ASAP.
## PC Creation step by step
1. Roll your [[pc-stats|Stats]].
2. Roll on the backstory table.
3. Roll on the connections table.
4. Take a few minutes to define and get to know your characters at the table.
5. Pick a social Tag.
6. Last touches.
7. Equipment.

### Rolling Stats
- **Luck:** A fresh PC starts with d4 as their [[luck|Luck]] Tier.
- **Chaos:** A fresh PC starts with a [[corruption-chaos-intrusive-thoughts|Chaos]] score of 20.
- **[[connections|Connections]] and [[wealth|Wealth]]:** Both start at Tier 1.

**For every other stat** do the following in order:
1. **Roll 2d6.**
2. **Keep the lowest** result as the Tier of that Stat.
3. You can decrease your **Luck Tier** by one to **pick the highest result**, instead.
4. If you **rolled doubles, add 10** to the **Corruption** score.

### Backstory
> The backstory defines the past of the character until the point where the game starts.

**Roll a d100 on the backstory table**, where you'll get:
- The **name** of the backstory. You can note it on the [[character-sheet|character sheets]].
- The **description** of the backstory. It is flavor text, and you can change and make it your own. The given text aims to be lore-friendly and to get your creativity running.
- A **Positive** and a **Negative trait**. Their contents vary a lot, but you should take their instructions and apply them logically. Modify stats accordingly, if needed.
### Connections
> The connections narrate an event shared by two characters in the past.

Connections affect the PC of the player who rolls, but also the PC of the player sitting to the right.

**Roll a d100 on the connection table**, to get:
- The **name** of the event. Note it on both [[character-sheet|character sheets]].
- The **description** of the event. It is meant to spark a discussion at the table, so the two PCs end up with a colorful situation they managed to survive.
- **Two different traits**, one for each PC. Their contents vary a lot, but you should take their instructions and apply them logically. Modify stats accordingly, if needed.

### Psychological Tag
> The Psychological Tag is the greatest aspect of the PC's psychology.

**The player creates a Wild Tag** for the PC in an **open discussion** at the table, where the GM has veto.

> [!important] The focus of the tag is to define an interesting and unique aspect of the PC's personality.
> - The tag must be **mainly social, psychological, intelectual or emotional.**
> - It might have repercussions on other aspects of play, like a fight, but **the Tag should not be used to gain physical power, combat prowess or to optimize the PC.**
> - This (and other psychological tags) substitute the social stats from other games.

The **Tier of the Tag is negotiated** with the GM, but it always **stays in the 1 to 3 range**. A **GM should reward interesting and creative Tags** that give depth to the PC. The GM can incentive the player by:
- Rewarding extra starting Luck to a PC.
- Offering a greater Tier for the tag Tag.

> [!tip] Creating interesting tags
> An interesting Tag is one that can both benefit and hinder the PC, always adding flavor and fun to the game. Think of vices, flaws, idiosyncrasies, ideologies...
### Last touches
>This is the moment to take a look at the PC and make the last adjustments.

Pick two options from the table. You can repeat an option

| Option                                                          | Restrictions                                                         |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Create a [[tag-classes\|Blank Tag]]                             | It must define an aspect of the PC's personality or their abilities. |
| Increase the [[tier-system\|Tier]] of a [[pc-stats\|Stat]] by 1 | Only for Physical, Mental or Social Standing stats.                  |

### Equipment
> At this point, the PC gets its equipment.

This step is dependent on the game or campaign you're playing, so it depends on the GM.

> [!example] Some possibilities are:
> - Being allowed to pick only one small item, because you're in prison.
> - Rolling on a table created for this or that occupation.
> - Being given a sheet with all the items available for the party, and having to pick who takes what.
> - Being assigned a standard uniform, a rifle, and sent to the front line.
