# Player Character Creation
> [!info] The style of characters
> This system is mainly intended for players to run human or abhuman characters in a cool, grimdark, science fantasy setting.
> 
> The PCs are not very powerful at the beginning and they don't progress to heroic levels easily. Nonetheless, they can be resourceful and three-dimensional from the get-go.



- Traveller-like past experiences? -> [[party-sheet]]
- Pick flaws for extra points
- Pick a social tag for free.
- Random stats -> point buy (?) -> stats qualify for classes / races
- Initial stats usually range between 25-55.
	- 3d10 + 10?
- Negative tags give more points to PC creation
