# Player Character Creation
> [!info] The style of characters
> This system is mainly intended for players to run human or abhuman characters in a cool, grimdark, science fantasy setting.
> 
> The PCs are not very powerful at the beginning and they don't progress to heroic levels easily. Nonetheless, they can be resourceful and three-dimensional from the get-go.

## PC Creation step by step
1. Roll your [[pc-stats|Stats]]:
2. Roll on the backstory table.
3. Roll on the connections.
4. Take a few minutes to define and get to know your characters at the table.
5. Pick a social Tag.
6. Last touches.

### Rolling Stats
- **Luck:** A fresh PC starts with d4 as their [[luck|Luck]] Tier.
- **Chaos:** A fresh PC starts with a [[chaos|Chaos]] score of 20.
- **[[connections|Connections]] and [[wealth|Wealth]]:** Both start at Tier 1.

**For every other stat** do the following in order:
1. **Roll 2d6.**
2. **Keep the lowest** result as the Tier of that Stat.
3. You can decrease your **Luck Tier** by one to **pick the highest result**, instead.
4. If you **rolled doubles, add 10** to the **Corruption** score.

### Backstory
Roll a d100 on the backstory table. Modify stats
### Connections
table to see the connection you have with the player to your right.
### Social Tag
social Wild Tag. It must define social behavior or a personality trait. The tier is negotiated with the GM, but it is in the 1 to 3 range. A tag that can be employed against the PC will be rewarded by also being a higher tier than one which is safe.
### Last touches
Pick two total:
- 1 or 2 [[tags|Blank Tags]].
- 1 or 2 Stat increases (Physical, Mental or Social Standing).
