# Space Tiers
> See [[tier-system]], [[tier-shifting]]

Defining space as a system of Tiers can be useful in situations like:
- Relating that Tier of Space with a [[time-tiers|Tier of Time]] to account for time spent travelling.
- Making rulings about distances in a [[combat]] or [[chase]] situation.
- Guessing the difficulty of a Check or Test where the hardest factor to overcome is a distance.

> [!important] Rulings over rules
> The important fact to know about using Space Tiers is that the Tier System can be used to regulate distances too. The following table is only orientative.

| Tier | Meaning in small scale                                                                                                                                       | Meaning in large scale                                                  |
