# Helping & Teamwork
> See [[rolling-dice]]

Helping and performing activities that require teamwork is super simple in this system. 

There are two possible cases:

| Situation                                 | Description                                                    | Roll  |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| **Help** somebody on their action.        | A PC is going to do an action, and other PC wants to help him. | Check |
| Perform **Teamwork in a common activity** | There is a task that more than one PC is trying to accomplish. | Test  |
## Helping
Any number of PCs can help another PC on a Check. To do so, **each helping PC must roll a Check of an appropriate Stat**.
- Like in any other test, the **selected Stat is is the one which better represents the action** the PC is doing to helps.
- The Check Tier can vary depending on the specific situation, but **by default** it is **the same as the Check the PC being helped will do**.

Results of Helping:
- **For each helping PC who passes the check**, the PC receiving the help has a **+1 Stat Tier bonus**.
- In addition, **from each [[criticals|Critical]] success** rolled by the helping PCs, **another +1 Stat Tier bonus** is granted to the PC being helped.

> > See [[order-of-play]]
> 
> If the order of play is kept strict, the biggest restriction to help any other character is that the PC being helped needs to go after the other PCs.

## Teamwork
Teamwork is already hard-coded in the rules for Tests. To do an activity relying on Teamwork, **each PC rolls independently**, and the **resulting Tiers of Success get added** towards the completion of the Test.
- The rolls are done sequentially, **each PC on their turn**.
- The **Tier of the Test might be modified** by the circumstances, but by **default stands the same** for everyone.
- **The Stat selected by each PC can be different from each other**. They simply need to be justified by the actions the PCs are performing.
